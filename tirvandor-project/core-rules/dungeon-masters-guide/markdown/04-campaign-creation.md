## Campaign Structure

### Episodic Campaigns

Structure: Self-contained adventures with recurring cast and setting

Pros:
- Easy for players to miss sessions
- Low commitment
- Clear endings
- Easy to run

Cons:
- Less epic feeling
- Character development slower
- Lower stakes

Good For:
- New players
- Inconsistent schedules
- Shorter campaigns

Example: Iron Guild Mercenaries
Each adventure is a contract. Client hires party for job. Complete job, get paid, next job. Recurring clients, growing reputation, but each mission stands alone.

### Serialized Campaigns

Structure: Interconnected adventures building toward major conclusion

Pros:
- Epic scope
- Satisfying payoffs
- Character arcs
- High stakes

Cons:
- Harder if players miss sessions
- Requires long-term commitment
- More planning required

Good For:
- Experienced players
- Consistent group
- Long campaigns

Example: Stopping Primordial Awakening
Each adventure reveals more about Primordial threat. Party strengthens seals, fights cults, uncovers conspiracy, all building toward final confrontation with awakening entity.

### Hybrid Structure (Recommended)

Structure: Episodic adventures with serialized backbone

How It Works:
- Main story progresses in background
- Most sessions are self-contained adventures
- Every 3-4 adventures, major plot advancement
- Players can miss sessions without losing thread

Example: Resistance Campaign
Session 1-3: Rescue prisoners (self-contained)
Session 4: Discover Thaldros attack plans (plot advancement)
Sessions 5-7: Steal supplies (self-contained)
Session 8: Betrayed by ally working for enemy (plot advancement)
Sessions 9-11: Infiltrate enemy fortress (self-contained)
Session 12: Thaldros invasion begins (major plot event)

## Campaign Planning

### Before Session Zero

1. Choose Core Theme:
Pick primary focus (War, Primordials, Intrigue, Personal)

2. Decide Campaign Length:
- Short: 10-20 sessions (Levels 1-10)
- Medium: 20-40 sessions (Levels 1-15)
- Long: 40+ sessions (Levels 1-20)

3. Outline Major Arcs:
Break campaign into 3-5 major story arcs

Example - War Campaign (30 sessions):
- Arc 1 (Levels 1-5, 8 sessions): Join Resistance, local operations
- Arc 2 (Levels 6-10, 10 sessions): Faction intrigue, spy network
- Arc 3 (Levels 11-15, 10 sessions): Major battles, political upheaval
- Conclusion (Level 15-16, 2 sessions): Peace treaty or final victory

4. Identify Key NPCs:
Create 5-10 major NPCs who will recur throughout campaign:
- Allies (quest givers, mentors)
- Rivals (competing heroes or factions)
- Villains (antagonists, growing threat)
- Neutrals (Iron Guild, merchants, informants)

5. Establish Factions:
Identify which factions matter and their agendas

### Session Zero

Goals:
- Set table expectations
- Create characters together
- Establish connections
- Explain campaign themes
- Set tone and boundaries

Agenda:

1. Pitch the Campaign (15 minutes):
Describe setting, themes, and tone. Be honest about content.

"This campaign focuses on the Resistance against Thaldros occupation. Themes include:
- Moral ambiguity (no clear good/evil)
- Difficult choices with consequences
- Guerrilla warfare and espionage
- Personal sacrifice for greater good

Tone: Serious but with moments of levity. Gritty realism mixed with heroic fantasy."

2. Safety Tools (10 minutes):
Establish X-card, lines and veils, consent checklist.
- What content should we avoid?
- What should we fade to black?
- How do we communicate discomfort?

3. Character Creation Together (60-90 minutes):
Create characters as group, not in isolation.

Connections: Each character must have:
- Connection to one other PC (established together)
- Reason to care about campaign theme
- Personal goal that can drive adventures

4. Establish Party Dynamic (15 minutes):
- How did you meet?
- Why do you trust each other?
- What's your group's dynamic?
- Do you have a name?

5. Set Logistics (10 minutes):
- Session length and frequency
- What happens if someone misses
- How to handle disagreements
- House rules

### Campaign Journal

Keep Notes On:

Sessions:
- What happened
- Player choices
- Consequences
- Unresolved threads
- Quotes

NPCs:
- Who they met
- Reactions to party
- Goals and secrets
- Status (alive, dead, allied, enemy)

Factions:
- Current relationship with party
- Recent actions
- Goals and setbacks

Plot Threads:
- Open questions
- Mysteries
- Future hooks
- Payoff timing

Review Before Each Session: Read last 2-3 sessions of notes.

## Tying Player Backstories

### Incorporating Backstories

During Campaign Planning:
Identify 2-3 elements from each character's backstory that can become adventures or plot threads.

Example - Character: Marcus, Ex-Thaldros Soldier
Backstory: Deserted when ordered to kill civilians. Mentor (Commander Vale) helped him escape.

Incorporated:
- Session 8: Commander Vale sends coded message asking for help
- Session 15: Vale captured, faces execution for treason
- Session 22: Vale reveals why he helped Marcus - bigger conspiracy

Distribution:
Each character should have:
- 2-3 backstory adventures (focused on them)
- Regular moments to shine using their skills
- Character development opportunities

### When to Focus on Each Character

Don't:
- Do every character's backstory at once
- Ignore certain characters
- Make backstory adventures feel disconnected from main plot

Do:
- Weave backstory into main campaign
- Give each character spotlight time every 3-4 sessions
- Connect character backstories to campaign themes

---

## Pacing the Campaign

### Session Pacing

Good Variety:
- Combat: 40%
- Social: 30%
- Exploration: 30%

Adjust Based on Table:
If players love combat, increase to 60%. If they prefer roleplay, decrease combat to 20%.

### Arc Pacing

Three-Act Structure for Each Arc:

Act 1 - Setup (2-3 sessions):
- Introduce arc's threat
- Establish stakes
- Give players goal

Act 2 - Development (3-5 sessions):
- Players pursue goal
- Complications arise
- Midpoint twist
- Stakes increase

Act 3 - Resolution (1-2 sessions):
- Final confrontation
- Consequences
- Transition to next arc

### Campaign Pacing

Early Campaign (Levels 1-5):
- Faster leveling (every 2-3 sessions)
- Smaller stakes
- Establish world and NPCs
- Build party dynamic

Mid Campaign (Levels 6-15):
- Moderate leveling (every 3-4 sessions)
- Escalating stakes
- Major plot developments
- Tough choices

Late Campaign (Levels 16-20):
- Slower leveling (every 4-5 sessions)
- World-ending stakes
- Epic encounters
- Building to conclusion

## Ending the Campaign

### Planning the Ending

Start with the End:
When planning campaign, know generally how it could end.

Example - Primordial Campaign:
Possible Endings:

| Roll | Result |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Reseal all Primordials, save world |
| 2 | Negotiate with Primordials, new world order |
| 3 | Primordials escape, survive apocalypse |
| 4 | Sacrifice to seal prisons permanently |


Don't force one ending. Prepare for 2-3 possibilities based on player choices.

### The Final Arc (Last 5-8 Sessions)

Structure:

Sessions 1-2: Gathering Allies
Call in favors, unite factions, prepare for final battle

Sessions 3-4: Final Preparations
Gather intelligence, craft weapons, final character moments

Session 5: Point of No Return
Launch final offensive, no going back

Sessions 6-7: Climax
Epic confrontation with primary threat, all choices matter

Session 8: Epilogue
Wrap up character arcs, show consequences, establish new normal

### Satisfying Endings

Good endings have:
- Direct result of player choices throughout campaign
- Every character gets moment to shine
- Clear victory or defeat conditions
- Consequences shown
- Emotional payoff
- Hints at characters' futures

Don't:
- Pull victory out of nowhere
- Ignore player choices in final moments
- Kill everyone for shock value
- Leave major threads unresolved
- Rush the ending

### Epilogue Session

After main campaign ends, dedicate one session to:

1. Immediate Aftermath (1 hour):
What happens right after final battle? Celebration? Mourning? Political shifts?

2. Character Fates (1-2 hours):
Go around table. Each player describes what their character does next:
- Do they retire? Continue adventuring?
- What relationships did they form?
- What's their legacy?

3. World State (30 minutes):
Describe how world changed because of party's actions:
- Political landscape
- Faction status
- Major NPCs
- Lasting impacts

4. Campaign Retrospective (30 minutes):
Out of character discussion:
- Favorite moments
- Lessons learned
- Thank yous
- Future plans
