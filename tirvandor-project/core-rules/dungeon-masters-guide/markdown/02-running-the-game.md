## Core Mechanics and Adjudication

## Ability Checks

### When to Call for Checks

Call for ability checks when:
- The outcome is uncertain
- Both success and failure have interesting consequences
- The action takes significant effort or skill

Don't call for checks when:
- The outcome is certain (routine tasks for skilled characters)
- Failure would just stop the story with no interesting outcome
- Success is impossible regardless of roll

### Setting Difficulty Classes

| Difficulty | DC | Example |
|------------|-----|---------|
| Very Easy | 5 | Notice something obvious, climb a knotted rope |
| Easy | 10 | Hear an approaching guard, climb a surface with ledges |
| Medium | 15 | Eavesdrop through a door, scale a brick wall |
| Hard | 20 | Hear a whisper through a door, climb a slippery sheer surface |
| Very Hard | 25 | Hear breathing through a door, climb an oiled wall |
| Nearly Impossible | 30 | Read lips from across a plaza, climb a perfectly smooth surface |

Most checks should be DC 15 (Medium). Reserve DC 25+ for legendary feats.

### Multiple Ability Options

When a task could use multiple abilities, let players describe their approach:

Example: Getting Past a Guard
- Strength (Athletics): Overpower and restrain
- Dexterity (Stealth): Sneak past without being seen
- Charisma (Deception): Convince guard you belong there
- Charisma (Intimidation): Threaten guard into letting you pass
- Intelligence (Investigation): Find alternate route by studying patrol patterns
- Wisdom (Insight): Determine when guard is distracted

The player's description determines which ability applies. Reward creative thinking.

### Group Checks

When the whole party attempts something together (crossing a rope bridge, sneaking past guards, rowing a boat in storm):

Method 1: Simple Majority
Everyone rolls. If more than half succeed, the group succeeds.

Method 2: Leader + Help
One character leads (rolls), others who succeed on DC 10 checks give advantage through the Help action.

Method 3: Best Applies
When one character's success helps everyone (ranger navigating, rogue scouting ahead), use the best result.

### Contests

When two creatures oppose each other (arm wrestling, chase, hiding vs seeking):
- Both roll appropriate ability checks
- Highest total wins
- Ties go to the creature with higher ability modifier
- If still tied, reroll

---

## Advantage and Disadvantage

### When to Grant Advantage

Favorable Circumstances:
- High ground in combat
- Target is restrained, prone, or unconscious
- Ally provides Help action
- Environmental factor aids the task (bright light for Perception, etc.)
- Creative player solution that makes sense

Don't Stack: Multiple sources of advantage don't stack. You either have it or you don't.

### When to Impose Disadvantage

Unfavorable Circumstances:
- Attacking while prone
- Attacker is blinded or can't see target
- Target has cover (for attacks)
- Environmental hindrance (darkness for Perception, noise for Stealth)
- Exhaustion levels 1-2
- Task is being rushed

Don't Stack: Multiple sources don't stack.

### Advantage/Disadvantage Cancel

If you have both advantage and disadvantage from any sources, they cancel completely. Roll one d20 normally, regardless of how many sources of each you have.

---

## Combat

### Initiative

Rolling Initiative:

| Roll | Result |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Situation becomes combat (violence is inevitable, trap springs, ambush happens) |
| 2 | Everyone rolls d20 + Dexterity modifier |
| 3 | DM ranks all combatants from highest to lowest |
| 4 | Ties: PCs win ties with monsters. Tied PCs/monsters choose their order. |


Tracking Initiative:
Write on paper or use tracker. Call out current turn and who's next: "Thea, you're up. Marcus, you're on deck."

Changing Initiative: Some DMs reroll each round. Others keep same order entire combat. Choose consistency.

### Actions in Combat

On Your Turn (in any order):
- Move: Up to your speed
- Action: One of the options below
- Bonus Action: If you have ability that grants one
- Object Interaction: One free (draw weapon, open door, etc.)
- Communication: Brief phrases, a few words

Standard Actions:
- Attack: Make one melee or ranged attack (more if Extra Attack)
- Cast a Spell: Cast one spell with casting time of 1 action
- Dash: Move again (up to your speed)
- Disengage: Move without provoking opportunity attacks
- Dodge: Attacks against you have disadvantage, you have advantage on Dex saves
- Help: Give ally advantage on ability check or next attack against creature you can see
- Hide: Make Dexterity (Stealth) check
- Ready: Prepare action to trigger on condition ("I attack if it comes through door")
- Search: Make Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check
- Use an Object: Interact with second object (first is free)

Reactions (Triggered, Not on Your Turn):
- Opportunity Attack: Enemy leaves your reach without Disengaging
- Spells: Some spells cast as reactions (Shield, Counterspell, etc.)
- Readied Action: Triggering condition occurs

### Movement

Speed: Move up to your speed in feet. Can split movement (move 10 ft, attack, move 20 ft more).

Difficult Terrain: Every foot costs 2 feet of movement (rubble, shallow water, undergrowth, steep stairs).

Prone: Standing from prone costs half your speed.

Climbing/Swimming: Usually costs 2 feet per foot moved (unless creature has climb/swim speed).

### Attacking

Melee Attack:

| Roll | Result |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Declare target within reach |
| 2 | Roll d20 + Strength modifier + proficiency bonus (if proficient) |
| 3 | Compare to target's AC |
| 4 | If equal or higher: Hit! Roll damage. |
| 5 | If lower: Miss. |


Ranged Attack:
Same as melee but uses Dexterity and has range limitations.

Cover: Target behind cover gets AC bonus

- Total cover (can't target): Completely concealed

Critical Hits: Natural 20 on attack roll
- Automatic hit regardless of AC

Damage at 0 HP:
- Any damage while at 0 HP: One death save failure

## Improvisation

### When Players Surprise You

Stay Calm: Players going unexpected directions is normal and good. It means they're engaged.

Ask Clarifying Questions:
- "What's your goal here?"
- "How do you imagine this working?"
- "What are you hoping to find?"

Use "Yes, And...":
Instead of shutting down ideas, build on them:
- Player: "Can I swing from the chandelier?"
- Bad: "No, that's not in the rules."
- Good: "Yes! Make an Athletics check. If you fail, it breaks and you fall."

### Quick NPC Creation

When you need an NPC right now:

Name: Use name list or combine syllables
Distinctive Feature: One physical trait (scar, accent, nervous tic)
Goal: What do they want?
Secret: What are they hiding?

Example:
- Name: Kerra
- Feature: Missing left ear
- Goal: Get enough money to leave town
- Secret: Secretly works for Iron Guild

### Quick Room Description

When party enters unexpected room:

Size and Shape: Small/medium/large, square/rectangular/circular
Purpose: What was this room for? (Bedroom, storage, shrine, guard post)
Condition: Pristine/dusty/damaged/destroyed
Notable Feature: One interesting thing (murals, weapons rack, altar, fireplace)
Exists: Obvious doors/windows

Example:
"You enter a medium-sized rectangular room. Looks like a guard barracks - three cots along the wall, weapons rack (empty now). Everything's covered in dust. The interesting part: someone has scratched a map into the wooden table in the center. You see three doors - one ahead, two on the sides."

### Saying "No" Gracefully

Sometimes you must refuse player ideas:

Bad: "No, you can't do that."
Better: "That won't work because [reason], but what if you [alternative]?"

Example:
- Player: "I want to convince the king to abdicate."
- DM: "The king won't abandon his kingdom based on one conversation, but you could plant seeds of doubt about his advisors. Maybe he'd take action against corrupt officials?"

---

## Pacing

### Recognizing Pacing Problems

Too Slow:
- Players checking phones
- Side conversations
- "What's happening?"
- Yawning
- Combat dragging

Too Fast:
- Players look confused
- Asking to repeat information
- Not engaging with scenes
- Feeling rushed

### Speeding Things Up

In Combat:
- Set turn timer (30-60 seconds)
- Roll multiple attacks together
- Describe outcomes cinematically
- Skip to interesting parts ("You fight through minions...")

In Exploration:
- Montage: "You spend three days traveling through forest. Anything specific you want to do?"
- Jump to next interesting scene
- Resolve routine tasks quickly

In Social Interaction:
- Get to the point: "What do you want from them?"
- Skip pleasantries unless character moment
- Resolve straightforward conversations in one roll

### Slowing Things Down

In Combat:
- Add description between turns
- Let players strategize briefly
- Ask what character is thinking/feeling

In Important Moments:
- Describe in detail
- Ask each player for their reaction
- Let scene breathe
- Allow roleplay

In Exploration:
- Add sensory details
- Ask "What are you looking for?"
- Zoom in on interesting features

### Scene Transitions

Cut Efficiently:
- "Three hours later..."
- "Meanwhile, at the castle..."
- "The next morning..."
- "After a week of travel..."

Don't play out every moment. Jump to interesting parts.

## Rulings Over Rules

### Making Fair Rulings

When situation isn't covered by rules:

1. Listen to player's intent
2. Determine appropriate ability + skill
3. Set DC based on difficulty
4. Consider advantage/disadvantage
5. Describe outcome based on roll

Note the ruling and apply it consistently afterward.

### When to Look Up Rules

Look it up:
- First time using complex rule
- Player challenges ruling
- Affects major outcome (death, TPK)

Don't look it up:
- Middle of intense moment
- Would break pacing
- You're reasonably sure of rule

Make ruling, note it, look it up after session.

### Admitting Mistakes

If you realize you ruled wrong:
- Acknowledge it: "I got that rule wrong."
- Correct it going forward: "From now on we'll do it this way."
- Don't retcon unless truly game-breaking
- Don't beat yourself up

---

## Using This Chapter

Reference these mechanics during play. Most important points:


| Roll | Result |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Most checks are DC 15 |
| 2 | Grant advantage/disadvantage liberally |
| 3 | Say "yes, and..." to player ideas |
| 4 | Keep combat moving |
| 5 | Cut boring parts, zoom into interesting parts |
| 6 | Make rulings, look up rules later |


The goal is fun and flow, not perfect rules mastery.
