## Combat Encounters

### Calculating Difficulty

XP Budget Method:


| Roll | Result |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Determine Party Level: Average level of all PCs |
| 2 | Count Players: Number of PCs (adjust for NPCs) |
| 3 | Find XP Threshold: |


| Level | Easy | Medium | Hard | Deadly |
|-------|------|--------|------|--------|
| 1 | 25 | 50 | 75 | 100 |
| 2 | 50 | 100 | 150 | 200 |
| 3 | 75 | 150 | 225 | 400 |
| 4 | 125 | 250 | 375 | 500 |
| 5 | 250 | 500 | 750 | 1,100 |
| 6-10 | Multiply by level | x2 | x3 | x4 |
| 11-15 | Multiply by level | x3 | x4.5 | x6 |
| 16-20 | Multiply by level | x4 | x6 | x8 |

4. Select Monsters: Add up monster XP until you reach threshold
Example:
- Party: 4 PCs, level 5
- Medium difficulty: 500 XP x 4 = 2,000 XP budget
- Options: 4x CR 2 monsters (450 XP each = 1,800 total)
- Or: 2x CR 3 (700 each = 1,400) + 1x CR 2 (450) = 1,850 XP

### Action Economy

Critical Rule: More creatures = tactical advantage

Adjustments:
- 1-2 monsters vs 4 PCs: Multiply monster XP by 0.5
- 3-6 monsters: Normal XP
- 7-10 monsters: Multiply XP by 1.5
- 11-14 monsters: Multiply XP by 2
- 15+ monsters: Multiply XP by 2.5

Boss Encounters:
- Single boss vs 4 PCs: Give boss legendary actions/lair actions
- Or: Boss + minions (50% XP from boss, 50% from minions)

---

## Using Terrain

Terrain turns simple combat into tactical challenge.

### Terrain Types

Difficult Terrain:
- Rubble, mud, thick vegetation
- Costs 2 feet of movement per 1 foot moved
- Use for 25-50% of battlefield

Cover:
- Half cover: +2 AC, +2 Dex saves
- Three-quarters cover: +5 AC, +5 Dex saves
- Full cover: Can't be targeted
- Place cover strategically for both sides

High Ground:
- Advantage on melee attacks from high ground
- Disadvantage on attacks from low ground
- Changes tactical positioning

Hazards:
- Pits (10-30 feet deep, 1d6/10 feet fall damage)
- Lava/fire (2d10 fire per turn)
- Acid pools (2d6 acid per turn)
- Unstable floors (DC 15 Dex save or fall through)

Interactive Elements:
- Chandeliers to drop (2d10 damage, DC 15 Dex save)
- Pillars to collapse (creates cover or blocks path)
- Levers/switches (activates traps or opens doors)
- Flammable materials (oil, gunpowder)

### Battlefield Zones

Divide battlefield into zones:

Kill Zone: Open area, no cover (dangerous to cross)
Defensive Positions: Cover and high ground
Objective Point: Important location (prisoner, artifact, control point)
Hazard Zone: Environmental danger
Escape Route: Clear path to exit (allows retreat)

---

## Monster Tactics

Different creatures fight differently:

Intelligent Humanoids:
- Use cover and formations
- Focus fire on weak targets
- Retreat when losing
- Negotiate if outmatched
- Use terrain advantages
- Call for reinforcements

Beasts/Animals:
- Attack nearest/weakest
- Fight to defend territory/young
- Flee when bloodied (50% HP)
- Simple tactics
- Use natural abilities

Undead:
- No morale, fight to destruction
- Mindless: attack nearest
- Intelligent: tactical, use abilities
- No self-preservation unless commanded

Constructs:
- Follow programming
- No fear or morale
- Predictable patterns
- Perfect execution

Primordial Corrupted:
- Aggressive, relentless
- Fearless (advantage vs fear)
- Unnatural tactics
- Fight to death
- Spread corruption

---

## Encounter Pacing

### Combat Length

Ideal combat: 3-5 rounds

Too Short (1-2 rounds):
- No tactical decisions
- Abilities wasted
- Unsatisfying

Too Long (8+ rounds):
- Players bored
- Slog, not challenge
- Resource drain without payoff

Extending Combat:
- Reinforcements arrive (round 3)
- Environment changes
- Boss transforms/powers up
- New objective appears

Ending Combat:
- Enemies retreat (not every fight to death)
- Players achieve objective (don't need to kill everything)
- Environmental change forces end
- Negotiation mid-combat

---

## Social Encounters

### Structure

Setup: Establish NPC goals and stakes
Roleplay: Players interact, make checks
Resolution: Outcome based on checks and roleplaying

### Setting DCs

Hostile NPC: DC 20+ (very difficult)
Unfriendly NPC: DC 15-20 (hard)
Indifferent NPC: DC 10-15 (medium)
Friendly NPC: DC 5-10 (easy)
Helpful NPC: DC 5 or auto-succeed

### Success Levels

Critical Success (beat DC by 10+): Major concession, enthusiasm
Success: Get what you want
Partial Success (miss by 1-5): Get something, with condition
Failure: Refuse, worsen relationship
Critical Failure (fail by 10+): Insult, permanent damage

### Multiple Participants

Aid Another: DC 10 check grants advantage to lead player
Different Approaches: Each player can try once with different skill
Group Check: All participate, majority determines outcome

---

## Exploration Encounters

### Puzzles

Good Puzzles:
- Have logical solution

- Failure has consequence (not blocking)
- Take 10-15 minutes real time

Bad Puzzles:
- Require meta-knowledge
- Only one solution
- No clues provided
- Block progress if unsolved
- Take 30+ minutes

Solution:
- Drop hints after 10 minutes
- Allow skill checks (DC 15 Intelligence) for clues
- Always have bypass option (break door, find key, etc.)

### Traps

Simple Trap:
- Detection DC
- Disarm DC
- Trigger condition
- Effect and damage

Example:
- Pit trap: DC 15 Perception to spot, DC 12 Dex save to avoid, 20 feet deep (2d6 damage)

Complex Trap:
- Multiple triggers
- Escalating danger
- Initiative rolls
- Requires multiple actions to disable
