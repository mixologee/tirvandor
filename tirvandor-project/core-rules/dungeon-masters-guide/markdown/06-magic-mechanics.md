# Magic Mechanics Deep Dive
## How Magic Really Works in Tirvandor

---

## Ley Line System

### Basic Mechanics

Proximity Bonus:
- Within 1 mile of ley line: +1 spell attack, +1 spell save DC
- At ley nexus (intersection): +2 bonus
- At corrupted nexus: +3 bonus, but Wild Magic risk

Detecting Ley Lines:
- *Detect magic* shows faint aura in direction of nearest ley line
- Arcana DC 15: Feel ley line within 1 mile
- Arcana DC 20: Determine direction and strength
- Druid/Ranger: Automatic awareness within 1 mile (part of natural world)

### Ley Line Map (DM Reference)

Major Nexuses:

| Roll | Result |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Silverpine Nexus: Beneath university, stable, heavily monitored |
| 2 | Ironhold Deep Forge: Dwarven-controlled, powers magical forges |
| 3 | Kaer Thandros Vault: Secret royal vault, emergency power source |
| 4 | Goldreach Harbor: Underwater, powers lighthouse and wards |
| 5 | The Singing Stones: Druid circle, portal to Feywild |
| 6 | Ashgate Catacombs: Unstable, partially corrupted |
| 7 | Nexus of Seven Sorrows: Fully corrupted, underwater |


Minor Ley Lines: Connect major nexuses. GMs can place 2d4 minor nodes per region as needed for plot.

## Spell Creation Rules

### Requirements
- Caster level ≥ spell level ×2
- Access to spell slot of desired level
- Arcana proficiency
- Downtime: 1 week per spell level
- Cost: 50 gp × spell level
- Workspace: Library or laboratory

### Process

1. Research Phase (3 days): Arcana check DC 10 + (spell level × 2)
- Failure: Lose 1 day, retry

2. Creation Phase (Remaining days): Arcana check DC 12 + (spell level × 2)
- Failure by <5: Spell flawed—works but with drawback
- Failure by 5+: Total failure, lose half materials

### Flawed Spells

Roll 1d6 if spell creation failed by <5:

| d20 | Result |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Unstable: Roll d20 when cast. On 1-2, wild magic surge. |
| 2 | Exhausting: Caster gains 1 level exhaustion after casting. |
| 3 | Obvious: Spell creates loud noise or bright flash. |
| 4 | Slow: Requires 1 round longer to cast. |
| 5 | Painful: Deals 1d6 damage per spell level to caster. |
| 6 | Unreliable: 10% chance spell simply fails when cast. |


Flawed spells can be fixed with another week of work and DC 15 Arcana check.

### Example Spells PCs Might Create

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: Self
- Duration: Special
- Effect: You step into a pocket dimension for up to 1 hour (your time). To outside observers, you disappear and reappear instantly. You age normally during this time.

Ley Line Sight (2nd level, divination)

## Artifact Rules

### Attunement

Artifacts require 1d4 days of attunement instead of 1 hour. During this time:
- Caster must spend 4 hours/day meditating with artifact
- Arcana DC 20 to successfully attune
- Failure: Take 4d10 psychic damage, can retry after long rest

### Sentient Artifacts

Tirvandor artifacts are often sentient. When attuning:

Conflict Check:
- If character alignment/goals oppose artifact: DC 18 Cha save
- Failure: Artifact refuses attunement, deals 8d10 psychic damage
- Success: Attunement works, but artifact is uncooperative (DM decides)

Cooperation:
- Aligned character: Artifact grants +2 to all DCs and attack rolls from its powers
- Neutral: Normal functionality
- Opposed: −2 penalty, artifact may betray wielder at dramatic moment

### Example Artifacts

The Worldrend Blade (Legendary longsword)
- +3 weapon, 3d8 extra force damage
- Once per day: Cast *disintegrate* (DC 19)
- Sentience: Int 16, Wis 14, Cha 18, LN alignment
- Goal: Prevent second Worldrend
- Personality: Stoic, values order and sacrifice

The Forgotten Crown (Legendary artifact)
- Wearer immune to divination
- 3 charges: Erase 1 minute of memory from all who witness an event (DC 20 Wis negates)
- Sentience: Int 20, Wis 8, Cha 12, CN alignment
- Goal: Catalog all forgotten lore
- Flaw: Occasionally erases wielder's memories (DM choice)

## Planar Travel

### Permanent Portals

- Singing Stones → Feywild: New moon only, druid key required
- Riftmaw → Elemental Chaos: Always open, extremely dangerous
- Black Archive → Demiplane: Faculty key required, one-way

### Creating Portals

Permanent Portal:
- Requires: 9th level spell slot, ritual at ley nexus, 100,000 gp materials
- Time: 10 days
- Check: Arcana DC 25
- Result: Two-way portal between nexuses

Temporary Portal:
- Use *gate* spell normally
- At ley nexus: Duration doubles, save DC +2

## Using Magic Mechanics

For Plot:
- PCs discover corrupted nexus, must cleanse it
- Villain creating artifact, PCs must interrupt ritual
- Ley lines failing, world's magic weakening

For Player Agency:
- Let wizards research spells
- Allow downtime crafting
- Reward creative ritual use

Balance:
- Spell creation is expensive and time-consuming
- Artifact creation is heroic sacrifice
- Wild Magic keeps ley nexuses risky
