---

## Quick NPC Creation

When you need an NPC immediately:

### 1. Name

Use name list or combine syllables:
- Thaldros names: Hard consonants (Karn, Brek, Thorne)
- Aethoria names: Flowing sounds (Lyra, Thael, Rina)
- Iron Guild: Practical (Smith, Iron, Forge) or nicknames (Red, Scar, Quick)

### 2. One Distinctive Feature

Physical trait players will remember:
- "Missing left ear"
- "Voice like gravel"
- "Nervous laugh"
- "Always humming"

### 3. Goal

What do they want right now?
- "Get rid of these adventurers"
- "Make enough coin to eat tonight"
- "Find out who killed their brother"

### 4. Secret

Something they're hiding:
- "Actually works for Iron Guild"
- "Primordial-touched (Stage 1)"
- "Secretly loves the king"
- "Witnessed the murder"

Example:
- Name: Kerra
- Feature: Missing left ear, nervous energy

## Full NPC Development

### Personality

Choose 2-3 traits:
- Personality: Brave, cowardly, aggressive, passive, sarcastic, earnest, suspicious, trusting
- Ideal: Freedom, power, justice, family, wealth, knowledge
- Bond: Person/place/thing they care about
- Flaw: Weakness or vice

### Voice and Mannerisms

Make them distinct:
- Speech pattern: Fast/slow, formal/casual, accent
- Quirk: Gesture, nervous habit, catchphrase
- How they address people: "Friend," "Citizen," names vs titles

### Relationships

Connection to:
- Party: Helpful? Hindering? Neutral?
- Factions: Which faction? What rank?
- Other NPCs: Allies, enemies, family

### Secrets and Layers

Three Layers:

| Roll | Result |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Surface: What everyone knows |
| 2 | Hidden: What careful observation reveals |
| 3 | Secret: What only investigation uncovers |


Example: Captain Marcus Vex
- Surface: Loyal Thaldros officer
- Hidden: Questions orders, sympathetic to civilians

## NPC Stat Blocks

### Use Existing Stat Blocks

Don't create from scratch. Modify existing:

For Non-Combatants:
- Commoner (CR 0)
- Noble (CR 1/8)

For Skilled NPCs:
- Guard (CR 1/8)
- Scout (CR 1/2)
- Spy (CR 1)
- Priest (CR 2)
- Knight (CR 3)
- Mage (CR 6)
- Assassin (CR 8)

### Modification Template

Base Creature: [Name from MM]
Modifications:
- HP: [Adjust if needed]
- Armor: [Different armor type]
- Weapons: [Change weapons]
- Skills: [Add/remove]
- Abilities: [Add faction-specific]

Example:

Thaldros Elite Guard
*Base: Knight (CR 3)*
Modifications:
- AC 20 (plate + shield with Thaldros crest)
- Weapons: Longsword and javelin
- Add: Pack Tactics (advantage when ally adjacent)
- Add: Disciplined (advantage on saves vs fear)

## Villain Design

### Goals and Motivations

Why are they the villain?
- Power: Want to rule
- Revenge: Wronged in the past
- Ideology: Believe they're right
- Survival: Desperate measures
- Corruption: Influenced by Primordial/evil

Good villains believe they're right.

### Methods

How are they achieving their goals?
- Manipulation and lies
- Brute force
- Political maneuvering
- Magic or technology
- Others' suffering

### Weaknesses

How can they be stopped?
- Physical: Vulnerable to specific damage
- Social: Can be turned against allies
- Moral: Won't cross certain lines
- Practical: Limited resources

### Backup Plans

What happens when players disrupt their plans?
- Contingency 1: [Alternative approach]
- Contingency 2: [Escalation]
- Final Gambit: [Desperate measure]

Don't railroad. If players beat villain's plan, villain should adapt or be defeated.

### Example: Captain Helena Vex

Goal: Prevent war between Thaldros and Aethoria
Motivation: Saw too much death, wants peace
Method: Defect to Resistance with military secrets
Weakness: Family still in Thaldros (leverage)
Backup Plans:

| Roll | Result |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | If discovered: Frame someone else |
| 2 | If captured: Fake loyalty, escape later |
| 3 | If desperate: Trade information for family's safety |

## Allies and Mentors

### Helpful NPCs

Quest Givers:
- Clear goals for party
- Appropriate rewards
- Information and resources
- Connections to other NPCs

Mentors:
- Teach skills or knowledge
- Provide guidance
- Challenge party to grow
- May die/retire to force independence

Contacts:
- Provide information
- Sell goods/services
- Connect party to opportunities
- May ask for favors

### Making Allies Interesting

Don't make them perfect:
- Faults and flaws
- Their own agendas
- Limitations and weaknesses
- Can be wrong about things

Give them agency:
- Act when party isn't around
- Have their own goals
- Make decisions that affect party
- Can die or leave

---

## Rivals and Competitors

Not enemies, but not quite friends:

Types:
- Friendly Rival: Competing for same goals, but mutual respect
- Antagonistic Rival: Actively working against party
- Reluctant Ally: Must work together despite friction

Examples:
- Another adventuring party
- Detective investigating same case
- Noble competing for same position
- Merchant undercutting prices

Benefits of Rivals:
- Create urgency (race to goal)
- Show alternative approaches
- Potential for alliance or betrayal
- Memorable recurring characters

- Limited information
- Replaceable

Mid Rank (Officers, Priests):
- Modified stat blocks
