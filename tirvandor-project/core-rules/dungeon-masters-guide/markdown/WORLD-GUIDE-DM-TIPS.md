## DM Tips: Using These Descriptions

## FROM: location-details-street-level.md - During Session:

### During Session:

Arrival:
Read or paraphrase the "Approaching" section. Set the scene with 2-3 sentences. Let players react.

Walking Through:
Use the "Typical Scene" descriptions. Pick 2-3 sensory details. Describe what they see, hear, smell.

Improvisation:
Use random detail tables. Roll when players wander or you need something happening. Makes world feel alive.

NPC Encounters:
Use architectural details to describe NPC homes. Wealthy merchant vs. poor laborer—description shows status.

### During Session:

Lead With Visuals:
Always describe what they see first. Make it vivid but brief—2-3 sentences.

Add Sound and Smell:
After visual, add one sound detail and one smell detail. Brings the world alive.

Let Players Direct:
After setting the scene, ask: "What do you do?" or "Where do you go?" They'll tell you what interests them.

Use Details to Answer Questions:
Player asks about the marketplace? Use your prepared details. Looking for a smith? Describe the forge district.
