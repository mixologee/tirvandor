## What Makes a Good Adventure

A good D&D adventure has:


| Roll | Result |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Clear Initial Hook: Players know why they're doing this |
| 2 | Meaningful Choices: Players decisions matter |
| 3 | Multiple Approaches: Combat isn't the only solution |
| 4 | Rising Tension: Stakes increase as adventure progresses |
| 5 | Satisfying Resolution: Clear ending with consequences |
| 6 | Player Agency: Players drive the story through their choices |


Bad adventure: Linear railroad with one solution

Good adventure: Situation with multiple possible outcomes based on player choices

---

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Establish the Premise (One Sentence)

What is this adventure about in one sentence?

Examples:
- "Rebels steal military supplies from Thaldros convoy"
- "Missing children lead to corrupt noble's secret"
- "Primordial corruption spreads from ancient ruin"
- "Rival factions compete for powerful artifact"

Good premises:
- Specific and actionable
- Have clear stakes
- Can be completed in 3-6 sessions

### Step 2: Identify the Villain or Threat

Who or what opposes the players?

Villain Checklist:
- Goal: What do they want?
- Method: How are they trying to achieve it?
- Weakness: How can they be stopped?
- Backup Plan: What if first plan fails?

Example: Captain Vex (Thaldros Officer)
- Goal: Capture Resistance leaders
- Method: Infiltrate with spies, set trap
- Weakness: Too confident, underestimates party
- Backup: Has reinforcements 1 hour away

Threat Checklist (Non-Villain):
- Source: Where does threat come from?
- Effect: What happens if not stopped?
- Solution: How can players stop it?
- Escalation: What if players fail or delay?

Example: Primordial Corruption
- Source: Weakened prison seal beneath city
- Effect: Citizens transform into spawns
- Solution: Reseal prison or evacuate city
- Escalation: More corrupted daily, eventually awakens Primordial

### Step 3: Design Key Locations

Identify 3-5 important locations for this adventure.

For Each Location:
- Purpose: What happens here?
- Description: What does it look/sound/smell like?
- Inhabitants: Who or what is here?
- Secrets: What's hidden here?
- Connections: How does this tie to other locations?

Example Locations:

| Roll | Result |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Resistance Safehouse - Party's base, information source |
| 2 | Thaldros Supply Depot - Target for heist |
| 3 | Border Crossing - Escape route, checkpoint encounter |
| 4 | Iron Guild Tavern - Neutral ground, negotiation possible |
| 5 | Primordial Ruin - Optional discovery, raises stakes |


### Step 4: Create Major NPCs

Design 3-5 important NPCs players will interact with.

For Each NPC:
- Name and Appearance: Distinctive feature
- Role: Ally? Enemy? Neutral?
- Goal: What do they want?
- Secret: What are they hiding?
- Offer: What can they give players?
- Ask: What do they want from players?

Example: Kerra the Smuggler
- Appearance: Missing left ear, nervous energy
- Role: Uneasy ally
- Goal: Make enough money to flee to Aethoria
- Secret: Secretly reports to Iron Guild
- Offer: Safe passage through checkpoint
- Ask: Cut of stolen supplies

### Step 5: Build Encounters

Design 4-8 encounters mixing combat, social, and exploration.

Encounter Types:

Combat Encounters:
- Planned fights (guards, monsters)
- Dynamic battlefields (fire, falling, cover)
- Objectives beyond "kill everything" (protect NPC, hold position, escape)

Social Encounters:
- Negotiations with opposing factions
- Gathering information from NPCs
- Convincing someone to help

Exploration Encounters:
- Searching ruins for clues
- Navigating dangerous terrain
- Solving puzzles or riddles

Aim for Mix:
- 40% combat
- 30% social
- 30% exploration

### Step 6: Plan Rewards

What do players gain?

Types of Rewards:
- Gold and Treasure: Standard, use CR-based tables
- Magic Items: 1-2 per adventure (based on level)
- Information: Maps, letters, intelligence
- Contacts: New NPCs who owe them favors
- Reputation: Faction influence points
- Story Progress: Answers to mysteries, plot advancement

Balance: Don't over-reward or under-reward. Match party level.

### Step 7: Prepare for Player Choices

Anticipate 3-4 likely player approaches:

Example: Stealing Supplies

Approach 1: Stealth
- Sneak in at night
- Disable guards quietly
- Load supplies and escape

Approach 2: Social
- Forge documents
- Bribe or convince guards
- Walk out with "authorized" supplies

Approach 3: Combat
- Attack during escort
- Fight through guards
- Take supplies by force

Approach 4: Alternative
- Discover supplies going elsewhere
- Hijack alternate route
- Avoid main depot entirely

Don't force one approach. Reward creativity.

## Adventure Structures

### Location-Based Adventures

Adventure centers on exploring a place (dungeon, city, wilderness).

Structure:

| Roll | Result |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Entrance: How players get in |
| 2 | Zones: Different areas with different threats/themes |
| 3 | Factions: Groups within location (may ally, fight, or ignore players) |
| 4 | Goal: What players seek (rescue, artifact, information) |
| 5 | Exit: How players get out (may be different from entrance) |


Good For: Dungeons, ruins, fortresses, cities

Example: Ancient Primordial Prison
- Entrance: Through collapsed temple
- Zones: Outer wards, prison cells, seal chamber
- Factions: Cultists trying to break seal, corrupted prisoners, constructs still guarding
- Goal: Reseal prison before Primordial breaks free
- Exit: Teleportation circle in seal chamber (risky) or climb back out

### Event-Based Adventures

Adventure follows sequence of events. Location changes as events unfold.

Structure:

| Roll | Result |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Inciting Incident: Event that kicks everything off |
| 2 | Rising Action: Series of encounters/scenes building tension |
| 3 | Complication: Unexpected twist raises stakes |
| 4 | Climax: Final confrontation or decision |
| 5 | Resolution: Immediate consequences of player actions |


Good For: Heists, chases, time-sensitive missions

Example: Supply Convoy Heist
- Inciting Incident: Learn convoy leaving tomorrow
- Rising Action: Gather information, plan attack, prepare ambush
- Complication: Convoy has unexpected magical defense
- Climax: Battle for the supplies
- Resolution: Escape with supplies, deal with pursuit

### Mystery Adventures

Adventure about uncovering truth. Players follow clues.

Structure:

| Roll | Result |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Crime/Mystery: Something happened, players investigate |
| 2 | Clues: Information pointing to suspects/locations |
| 3 | Red Herrings: False leads that seem promising |
| 4 | Revelation: Key discovery that clarifies situation |
| 5 | Confrontation: Confront culprit or reveal truth |
| 6 | Resolution: Justice, consequences, lingering questions |


Good For: Murders, conspiracies, missing persons

Example: Missing Children
- Crime: Five children vanished from Border village
- Clues: Footprints lead to noble's estate, children wore iron collars, witnessed strange lights
- Red Herrings: Local hermit seems suspicious, rumors of monsters
- Revelation: Noble conducting experiments on children for Primordial cult
- Confrontation: Infiltrate estate, rescue children, stop ritual
- Resolution: Noble arrested or escapes, cult exposed or stays hidden

Three-Clue Rule: For any key information players need, provide at least three different ways to find it. If they miss two, they'll still get it.

## Pacing and Tension

### Five-Act Structure

Act 1: Introduction (Session 1)
- Present hook
- Introduce key NPCs
- Establish stakes
- Give players clear short-term goal

Act 2: Rising Action (Session 1-2)
- Players pursue goal
- Encounters increase in difficulty
- New information complicates situation
- Players make meaningful choices

Act 3: Midpoint Twist (Session 2-3)
- Major revelation changes everything
- Stakes increase dramatically
- New threat or ally emerges
- Players must adapt plan

Act 4: Approaching Climax (Session 3-4)
- Final preparations
- Point of no return
- All pieces come together
- Building to showdown

Act 5: Climax and Resolution (Session 4)
- Major encounter/decision
- All previous choices matter
- Clear victory or defeat conditions
- Immediate consequences
- Seeds for next adventure

### Building Tension

Early Adventure (Sessions 1-2):
- Easier encounters
- Success comes easier
- Players feel capable
- Information flows

Middle Adventure (Sessions 2-3):
- Harder encounters
- Complications arise
- Resources depleting
- Time pressure introduced

Late Adventure (Sessions 3-4):
- Hardest encounters
- Multiple threats at once
- Resources scarce
- High stakes, real danger

### Using Time Pressure

Introduce countdown or deadline:
- "Ritual completes in 3 days"
- "Convoy leaves at dawn"
- "Corruption spreading, infects 1d6 more citizens daily"

Each session: Advance the countdown. Make consequences clear.

If players delay: Bad things happen. Don't pull punches, but don't make it impossible either.

## Common Mistakes

### Railroad Adventures

Problem: Players have no real choices. One path only.

Fix: Always provide 2-3 ways to approach situations. Accept unexpected solutions.

### Killer DM

Problem: Adventure designed to kill players or "beat" them.

Fix: Challenge players, but give them tools to succeed. Death should result from bad choices, not unfair design.

### No Stakes

Problem: Nothing bad happens if players fail or delay.

Fix: Establish clear consequences. If players ignore quest, things get worse.

### Too Many NPCs

Problem: Players can't remember who's who.

Fix: Limit to 5-6 major NPCs per adventure. Give each distinctive feature.

### Info Dump

Problem: Pages of backstory dumped on players.

Fix: Reveal information through play. Show, don't tell. Let players discover it.

### Ignoring Player Choices

Problem: Players' decisions don't matter, everything leads to same outcome.

Fix: Make player choices have real consequences. Branch the adventure.
