## PROPAGANDA & MANIPULATION SPELLS

### 1. PROPAGANDIST'S WHISPER
*1st-level enchantment*

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 hour  
**Classes:** Bard (College of Propaganda)

You whisper a rumor or false belief into a creature's mind. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target believes the rumor to be true for the duration. The rumor must be believable and not immediately contradicted by obvious evidence. 

If the target succeeds on the save, it doesn't believe the rumor but isn't aware you tried to manipulate it.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.

---

### 2. MASS HYSTERIA
*3rd-level enchantment*

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a torn piece of propaganda)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute  
**Classes:** Bard (College of Propaganda), Warlock

You spread panic through a crowd. Each creature of your choice in a 20-foot radius sphere within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened of you for the duration and must use its action to take the Dash action away from you on each of its turns.

Additionally, frightened creatures have disadvantage on ability checks and can spread the fear—any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of a frightened creature must make a Wisdom save or also become frightened.

A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the radius increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 3rd.

---

### 3. REWRITE MEMORY
*5th-level enchantment*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (a page from a history book worth at least 50 gp)  
**Duration:** Permanent until dispelled  
**Classes:** Bard (College of Propaganda), Wizard

You touch a willing creature or one that is incapacitated and rewrite one of its memories. You can alter a memory of an event that lasted no more than 10 minutes and occurred within the last 30 days. You can add false details, remove real details, or completely fabricate a new memory.

The target believes the altered memory to be true. The effect is permanent but can be ended by *greater restoration*, *heal*, *wish*, or similar magic. A creature that witnesses evidence strongly contradicting the false memory can make a Wisdom saving throw to realize the memory is false.

---

### 4. VOICE OF AUTHORITY
*2nd-level enchantment*

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** 1 round  
**Classes:** Bard, Cleric (Ascended Champion - Thandros), Paladin (Oath of the Iron Crown)

You speak with undeniable authority. Choose one creature within range that can hear you. It must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it must obey a one-sentence command on its next turn (as long as the command isn't directly harmful to it). The command is more complex than the *command* spell and can include conditional instructions.

Examples: "Drop your weapon and surrender," "Tell me where the artifact is hidden," "Escort us safely through this area."

The target understands the command even if it doesn't share a language with you.

## WARLOCK PATRON SPELLS

### 5. CROWN OF THE FALLEN KING
*3rd-level illusion*

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes  
**Classes:** Warlock (Pact of the Forgotten Throne)

A spectral crown appears on your head, marking you as royalty. For the duration, you gain the following benefits:

- You have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) and Charisma (Persuasion) checks.
- Creatures of CR 1 or lower that can see you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or treat you as a legitimate authority figure, obeying reasonable commands.
- You can cast *command* at will without expending a spell slot.
- Once during the spell's duration, you can use a bonus action to force one creature within 30 feet to kneel (fall prone, speed 0 until end of its next turn) if it fails a Wisdom saving throw.

---

*2nd-level necromancy*

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute  
**Classes:** Warlock (Pact of the War Profiteer)

- Your spell attacks gain a +2 bonus to hit.
- When you deal damage with a warlock spell, you deal an extra 1d6 damage.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you take an additional 1d6 necrotic damage and the extra spell damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

**Classes:** Warlock (Pact of the Forgotten Throne)

You summon the spirit of an ancient noble from your patron's fallen dynasty. The spirit appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range and uses the **ghost** stat block, but it's friendly to you and your allies and obeys your commands.

The spirit has knowledge of history, nobility, and ancient lore. It can answer questions about the past (as if you had cast *legend lore*) and provide information about noble protocols and ancient customs.

In combat, the spirit acts on your turn and uses its ghostly abilities to aid you.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can summon one additional spirit for each slot level above 4th.

**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** 1 round  
**Classes:** Warlock (Pact of the War Profiteer)

When violence erupts nearby, your patron's power shields you. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + your warlock level. Additionally, until the start of your next turn, you have resistance to all damage.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the temporary hit points increase by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.

**Duration:** Until fulfilled or 30 days  
**Classes:** Bard (College of the Iron Tongue), Fighter (Iron Guild Veteran)

You create a magically binding contract between willing participants. All parties must sign or mark the contract. The contract specifies terms and conditions (DM determines reasonableness).

## DESIGN NOTES

**Balance Considerations:**

All spells are designed to be:
- **Comparable in power** to official spells of the same level
- **Thematically appropriate** for Tirvandor
- **Mechanically sound** within 5e rules
- **Flavorful** without being overpowered

**Spell Schools:**
- Enchantment: 6 spells (manipulation, control)
- Abjuration: 3 spells (protection, freedom)
- Evocation: 1 spell (damage)
- Divination: 2 spells (awareness, tactics)
- Conjuration: 1 spell (summoning)
- Necromancy: 1 spell (life force)
- Transmutation: 1 spell (chaos magic)

**Power Level:**
- Slightly stronger than baseline for signature subclass spells
- Balanced by specificity (only certain subclasses get them)
- Most have drawbacks or limitations
- Higher level spells (3rd+) are appropriately powerful

**Integration:**
These spells should be automatically added to the spell lists of the subclasses noted above. Players don't need to choose them—they're part of the subclass features or expanded spell lists.
