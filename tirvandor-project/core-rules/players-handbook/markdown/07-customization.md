# CHAPTER 6: CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS

## MULTICLASSING

Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.

### PREREQUISITES

To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one.

| Class | Ability Score Minimum |
|-------|-----------------------|
| Barbarian | Strength 13 |
| Bard | Charisma 13 |
| Cleric | Wisdom 13 |
| Druid | Wisdom 13 |
| Fighter | Strength 13 or Dexterity 13 |
| Monk | Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13 |
| Paladin | Strength 13 and Charisma 13 |
| Ranger | Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13 |
| Rogue | Dexterity 13 |
| Sorcerer | Charisma 13 |
| Warlock | Charisma 13 |
| Wizard | Intelligence 13 |

### EXPERIENCE POINTS

The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class.

### HIT POINTS AND HIT DICE

You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.

### PROFICIENCY BONUS

Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class.

### PROFICIENCIES

When you gain a level in a class other than your first, you gain only some of that class's starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table in the D&D 5e rules.

### CLASS FEATURES

You get all the class features of all your classes, but you must meet level requirements individually for each class.

### SPELLCASTING

Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. (Refer to D&D 5e rules for multiclass spellcasting details)

## FEATS

A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides.

### GAINING FEATS

At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can't take a feat more than once, unless the feat's description says otherwise.

### FEAT PREREQUISITES

Some feats have prerequisites. You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat's prerequisite, you can't use that feat until you regain the prerequisite.

### SAMPLE FEATS

Common feats include (refer to D&D 5e SRD for full details):

- **Alert:** +5 initiative, can't be surprised
- **Athlete:** Improved climbing, jumping, standing
- **Grappler:** Advantage on grapple attacks
- **Lucky:** 3 luck points per long rest
- **Magic Initiate:** Learn cantrips and 1st-level spell
- **Tough:** +2 HP per level
- **War Caster:** Advantage on concentration, cast while wielding

(Refer to D&D 5e SRD or Player's Handbook for complete feat list)

### TIRVANDOR FEATS

Your DM may allow campaign-specific feats:

- **Ley Line Attuned:** Enhanced magic near ley lines
- **Border Survivor:** Expertise in contested territories
- **Iron Guild Veteran:** Combat and mercenary skills
