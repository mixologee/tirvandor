# CHAPTER 4: PERSONALITY & BACKGROUND

## CHARACTER DETAILS

Every character has unique personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws that define who they are beyond their race and class.

### ALIGNMENT

A typical creature in Tirvandor has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral).

- **Lawful Good** (LG): Honor and compassion
- **Neutral Good** (NG): Helps others without bias
- **Chaotic Good** (CG): Acts with conscience and freedom
- **Lawful Neutral** (LN): Follows law and tradition
- **True Neutral** (N): Avoids extremes
- **Chaotic Neutral** (CN): Values personal freedom
- **Lawful Evil** (LE): Methodically takes what they want
- **Neutral Evil** (NE): Does whatever they can get away with
- **Chaotic Evil** (CE): Acts with violence and unpredictability

For player characters in Tirvandor, discuss alignment choices with your DM as they relate to campaign themes.

## INSPIRATION

Inspiration is a rule your DM can use to reward you for playing your character in compelling ways. Your DM can award inspiration when you:

- Play to your personality traits, ideals, bonds, or flaws
- Make a meaningful character choice
- Create memorable roleplaying moments
- Contribute to the story in interesting ways

When you have inspiration, you can spend it to gain advantage on one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. You either have inspiration or you don't - you can't stockpile multiple inspirations.
