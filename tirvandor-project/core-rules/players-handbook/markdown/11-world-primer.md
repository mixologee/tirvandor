## GEOGRAPHY

Tirvandor consists of two great continents separated by the Sundering Sea.

### THALDROS (THE WESTERN CONTINENT)

An authoritarian empire ruled by the Iron Crown from the capital city of Kaer Thandros. The land is organized, efficient, and tightly controlled.

**Major Cities:**
- **Kaer Thandros:** Imperial capital, seat of power
- **Goldreach:** Major port and trade hub
- **Ironhold:** Dwarven mountain fortress city

**Government:** Centralized monarchy with military enforcement

### AETHORIA (THE EASTERN CONTINENT)

A collection of democratic free states where personal liberty and self-governance reign. Less unified but more free than Thaldros.

**Major Cities:**
- **Aethermere:** Largest free city, council-governed
- **Silverpine:** University city, center of learning
- **Various settlements:** Each self-governing

**Government:** Democratic councils and elected leaders

### THE CONTESTED LANDS (THE BORDER)

The lawless region between Thaldros and Aethoria where neither side holds control. Home to refugees, mercenaries, bandits, and those who've chosen freedom over allegiance to either side.

### THE SUNDERING SEA

The magical sea that separates the two continents, created by the catastrophic Worldrend event 800 years ago. Difficult to cross, full of magical anomalies.

## HISTORY

### THE AGE OF UNITY (Ancient Past)

Before the Worldrend, Tirvandor was one unified land. The details are lost to time, but legends speak of a golden age.

### THE SUNDERING (800 Years Ago)

A catastrophic magical event tore the world in two, creating the Sundering Sea. The cause is debated - some blame hubris, others blame the gods. What's certain is that millions died and civilization collapsed.

### THE AGE OF CHAINS (700-400 Years Ago)

Following the Worldrend, warlords and tyrants rose to power. Might made right, and common folk suffered under brutal rule.

### THE LIBERATION (400 Years Ago)

In Aethoria, a revolutionary movement overthrew the tyrants and established democratic governance. This event is celebrated as the founding of free Aethoria.

### THE IRON CROWN ERA (200 Years Ago - Present)

In Thaldros, the Iron Crown consolidated power and established the current empire. Thaldros claims to bring order and stability; Aethoria calls it tyranny.

### THE PRESENT DAY

Tensions between Thaldros and Aethoria remain high. The Contested Lands grow more dangerous. Strange magical phenomena increase near ley lines. Your adventure begins in this uncertain time.

## MAGIC

Magic in Tirvandor flows through **ley lines** - natural channels of magical energy that crisscross the world.

### LEY LINES

## THE SEVEN PRIMORDIALS (GODS)

The gods of Tirvandor are called the Seven Primordials - ancient beings who shaped the world.

1. **Aethor** - Liberation, freedom, revolution (Good)
2. **Sylvara** - Nature, wilderness, growth (Neutral)
3. **Volcanus** - Forge, craft, creation (Neutral Good)
4. **Mordain** - Law, order, justice (Lawful Neutral)
5. **Corvus** - Knowledge, secrets, death (Neutral)

Most people in Tirvandor worship all Seven depending on need, though individuals may favor one over others.
