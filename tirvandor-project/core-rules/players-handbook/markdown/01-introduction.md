## ABOUT TIRVANDOR

Tirvandor is a world divided by history, politics, and magic. A catastrophic event known as **The Worldrend** tore the world in two, creating the **Sundering Sea** between two great continents.

**Thaldros** - An authoritarian empire ruled by the Iron Crown, where order and control reign supreme. Military discipline, strict laws, and centralized power define daily life.

**Aethoria** - Free democratic states where personal liberty and self-governance are paramount. Merchant councils, elected leaders, and individual rights shape society.

Between them lies **The Contested Lands** - a lawless border region where neither side holds sway, filled with refugees, mercenaries, and those who've chosen freedom over allegiance.

Magic in Tirvandor flows through **ley lines** - natural channels of energy that crisscross the world. These lines of power make some locations more magically potent than others and tie directly into the world's history.

The choices you make in Tirvandor matter. This is not a world of clear heroes and villains - it's a world where good people make hard decisions, where loyalty is tested, and where your actions have lasting consequences.

## A NOTE ON MORALITY

Tirvandor campaigns explore moral complexity and meaningful choice. You may face situations where:

- There is no clear "right" answer
- Good people disagree on the best course of action
- Your character's values conflict with the party's goals
- Choices have unexpected consequences
- Authority figures aren't always trustworthy
- The "enemy" has understandable motivations

This doesn't mean anything goes - heroism, compassion, and standing up for what's right still matter. It means your character will face genuine dilemmas and have to live with their choices.

Talk with your DM and fellow players about the tone and themes of your campaign. Make sure everyone at the table is comfortable with the level of moral complexity in the game.

## HOW TO CREATE A CHARACTER

Character creation in Tirvandor follows the standard D&D 5e process with some Tirvandor-specific flavor added. The full step-by-step process is covered in Chapter 2, but here's the quick overview:

**Step 1: Choose a Race**  
Select from nine standard fantasy races (Chapter 3), each with cultural context for how they fit into Tirvandor society.

**Step 2: Choose a Class**  
Pick one of twelve adventuring classes (Chapter 4) that defines your character's abilities and role in combat.

**Step 3: Determine Ability Scores**  
Roll or assign scores to your six core abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.

**Step 4: Describe Your Character**  
Choose a background (Chapter 5), personality traits, and physical appearance. Give your character depth and history.

**Step 5: Choose Equipment**  
Select starting gear and weapons (Chapter 6) based on your class and background.

**Step 6: Come Together**  
Work with your party to establish relationships and shared goals. Decide why you're adventuring together.

Once your character is created, you're ready to play!
