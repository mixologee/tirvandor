*"Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human."*

### **DWARF TRAITS**

**Ability Score Increase:** Your Constitution score increases by 2.

**Age:** Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they're considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years.

## ELF

*"Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light."*

### **ELF TRAITS**

**Ability Score Increase:** Your Dexterity score increases by 2.

**Age:** Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.

**Alignment:** Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not.

**Speed:** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Darkvision:** Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**Keen Senses:** You have proficiency in the Perception skill.

**Fey Ancestry:** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.

**Trance:** Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

**Languages:** You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races.

**Subraces:** Ancient divides among the elven people resulted in three main subraces: high elves, wood elves, and dark elves (drow).

### **HIGH ELF**

**Ability Score Increase:** Your Intelligence score increases by 1.

### **ELVES IN TIRVANDOR**

- Long lifespan makes them seem detached from "mortal concerns"

The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one.
