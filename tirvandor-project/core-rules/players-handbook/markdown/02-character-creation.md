# CHAPTER 1: STEP-BY-STEP CHARACTERS

## CHARACTER CREATION OVERVIEW

Your first step in playing an adventurer in Tirvandor is to imagine and create a character of your own. Your character is a combination of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your imagination.

**The process has six steps:**

1. **Choose a Race:** Human, dwarf, elf, or another fantasy species
2. **Choose a Class:** Fighter, wizard, cleric, or another adventuring profession
3. **Determine Ability Scores:** Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma
4. **Describe Your Character:** Physical appearance, personality, background
5. **Choose Equipment:** Weapons, armor, gear, and starting gold
6. **Come Together:** Connect with your party

**Record everything on a character sheet.** See Appendix C for blank sheet.

---

## STEP 1: CHOOSE A RACE

Every character belongs to a race, one of the many intelligent humanoid species in Tirvandor. The most common races are humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Some races have subraces, such as mountain dwarf or wood elf.

**Chapter 2 provides detailed information on these races:**
- Humans
- Dwarves (Hill, Mountain)
- Elves (High, Wood, Dark)
- Halflings (Lightfoot, Stout)
- Dragonborn
- Gnomes (Forest, Rock)
- Half-Elves
- Half-Orcs
- Tieflings

**Your race choice gives you:**
- **Ability Score Increase:** Racial bonus to one or more ability scores
- **Size:** Small or Medium
- **Speed:** How far you move in a round
- **Special Traits:** Darkvision, skill proficiencies, resistances, etc.

**In Tirvandor context:**
Your race also determines how NPCs may react to you. See Chapter 2 for cultural notes on each race in Tirvandor society.

---

## STEP 2: CHOOSE A CLASS

Every adventurer is a member of a class. Class broadly describes a character's vocation, special talents, and tactics.

**Chapter 3 provides detailed information on these classes:**
- Barbarian (Primal warrior)
- Bard (Inspiring musician and jack-of-all-trades)
- Cleric (Priestly divine caster)
- Druid (Nature priest and shapeshifter)
- Fighter (Master of martial combat)
- Monk (Martial artist)
- Paladin (Holy warrior with divine oaths)
- Ranger (Wilderness warrior)
- Rogue (Scoundrel with stealth and precision)
- Sorcerer (Innate magic)
- Warlock (Pact magic from otherworldly patron)
- Wizard (Scholarly magic)

**Your class gives you:**
- **Hit Points:** How much damage you can take
- **Proficiencies:** Armor, weapons, saves, skills, tools
- **Equipment:** Starting gear
- **Class Features:** Special abilities (spellcasting, rage, etc.)

**Level 1 is just the beginning.** As you gain experience, your class determines your capabilities at higher levels.

## STEP 3: DETERMINE ABILITY SCORES

Much of what your character does depends on six abilities:

**Strength (STR):** Physical power  
**Dexterity (DEX):** Agility and reflexes  
**Constitution (CON):** Endurance  
**Intelligence (INT):** Reasoning and memory  
**Wisdom (WIS):** Awareness and intuition  
**Charisma (CHA):** Force of personality  

**Ability Score Summary:**

| Score | Modifier | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | -5 | Severely limited |
| 2-3 | -4 | Greatly impaired |
| 4-5 | -3 | Significantly below average |
| 6-7 | -2 | Below average |
| 8-9 | -1 | Slightly below average |
| 10-11 | +0 | Average human |
| 12-13 | +1 | Slightly above average |
| 14-15 | +2 | Above average |
| 16-17 | +3 | Significantly above average |
| 18-19 | +4 | Exceptional |
| 20-21 | +5 | Legendary |

### **METHOD 1: STANDARD ARRAY**

**Most balanced and fair method.**

Use these six numbers: **15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8**

Assign them to your six abilities in any order you prefer.

**Example:** Fighter wants high STR and CON
- Strength: 15
- Dexterity: 13
- Constitution: 14
- Intelligence: 8
- Wisdom: 10
- Charisma: 12

Then apply racial bonuses (Step 1).

---

### **METHOD 2: POINT BUY**

**Customizable method for optimization.**

**You have 27 points to spend.**

**Ability Score Costs:**

| Score | Point Cost |
|-------|-----------|
| 8 | 0 |
| 9 | 1 |
| 10 | 2 |
| 11 | 3 |
| 12 | 4 |
| 13 | 5 |
| 14 | 7 |
| 15 | 9 |

**Rules:**
- No score lower than 8 or higher than 15 before racial bonuses
- Calculate total cost, must equal 27 points
- Apply racial bonuses after point buy

**Example:** Wizard wants high INT
- Strength: 8 (0 points)
- Dexterity: 14 (7 points)
- Constitution: 14 (7 points)
- Intelligence: 15 (9 points)
- Wisdom: 10 (2 points)
- Charisma: 10 (2 points)
- **Total: 27 points**

Then apply racial bonuses.

---

### **METHOD 3: ROLLING**

**Random and exciting method. DM must approve.**

**Roll 4d6, drop lowest, six times.**

1. Roll 4d6 (four six-sided dice)
2. Remove the lowest die
3. Add the three remaining dice
4. Record the total
5. Repeat five more times
6. Assign the six totals to abilities in any order

**Example rolls:**
- Roll: 4, 6, 5, 2 → Drop 2 → Total: 15
- Roll: 3, 6, 6, 1 → Drop 1 → Total: 15
- Roll: 5, 4, 3, 4 → Drop 3 → Total: 13
- Roll: 2, 3, 5, 6 → Drop 2 → Total: 14
- Roll: 4, 3, 2, 4 → Drop 2 → Total: 11
- Roll: 1, 3, 4, 4 → Drop 1 → Total: 11

Results: 15, 15, 14, 13, 11, 11

Then apply racial bonuses.

---

### **VARIANT: CUSTOMIZING ABILITY SCORES (OPTIONAL)**

**Tasha's Cauldron of Everything optional rule:**

Your DM may allow you to reassign racial ability score increases.

**Instead of fixed racial bonuses:**
- Assign +2 to one ability
- Assign +1 to another ability
- Or three +1 bonuses

**Example:** Dragonborn traditionally gets +2 STR, +1 CHA
- Could instead take +2 INT, +1 WIS for wizard concept

**Check with your DM before using this variant.**

---

### **APPLYING RACIAL BONUSES**

After determining base scores, add racial bonuses from your chosen race (Chapter 2).

**Example:** Human Fighter using Standard Array
- Base: STR 15, DEX 13, CON 14, INT 8, WIS 10, CHA 12
- Human bonus: +1 to all abilities
- Final: STR 16, DEX 14, CON 15, INT 9, WIS 11, CHA 13

**Example:** Mountain Dwarf Fighter using Standard Array
- Base: STR 15, DEX 12, CON 14, INT 8, WIS 13, CHA 10
- Dwarf bonus: +2 CON, +2 STR
- Final: STR 17, DEX 12, CON 16, INT 8, WIS 13, CHA 10

---

### **CALCULATING MODIFIERS**

Once you have final ability scores, determine modifiers:

**Formula:** (Ability Score - 10) ÷ 2, rounded down

**Or use this table:**

| Score | Modifier | Score | Modifier |
|-------|----------|-------|----------|
| 1 | -5 | 16-17 | +3 |
| 2-3 | -4 | 18-19 | +4 |
| 4-5 | -3 | 20-21 | +5 |
| 6-7 | -2 | 22-23 | +6 |
| 8-9 | -1 | 24-25 | +7 |
| 10-11 | +0 | 26-27 | +8 |
| 12-13 | +1 | 28-29 | +9 |
| 14-15 | +2 | 30 | +10 |

**Write the modifier next to each ability score on your character sheet.**

---

## STEP 4: DESCRIBE YOUR CHARACTER
