## PATH OF THE BORDER REAVER (Barbarian)

*Mercenary raiders from the lawless Border regions who have mastered brutal, adaptable combat*

The Border is a harsh place where only the strong survive. Border Reavers are barbarians who have learned to channel their rage into calculated violence, fighting dirty when needed and adapting to any battlefield. They're professional survivors who turn their fury into a weapon for hire.

### **REAVER'S INSTINCT (3RD LEVEL)**

When you choose this path at 3rd level, your survival instincts become supernaturally sharp. You gain the following benefits:

- **Always Ready:** You gain a bonus to initiative rolls equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum +1). You can't be surprised while you are conscious.

- **Scavenger:** When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you can use your bonus action to immediately search the body. You find 1d10 gold pieces, one use of a consumable item (DM's choice: potion, ammunition, etc.), or useful battlefield information.

- **Adaptable Combatant:** When you finish a short or long rest, choose one damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. While raging, you have resistance to that damage type. You can change your choice when you finish another short or long rest.

### **DIRTY FIGHTING (6TH LEVEL)**

Starting at 6th level, you've learned that honor means nothing in a real fight. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack while raging, you can choose to fight dirty. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or suffer one of the following effects of your choice:

- **Sand in the Eyes:** The target is blinded until the end of your next turn.
- **Low Blow:** The target's speed is reduced to 0 until the end of your next turn.
- **Disarm:** The target drops one item it is holding (your choice).

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### **REAVER'S ENDURANCE (10TH LEVEL)**

At 10th level, your time surviving in the brutal Border has made you incredibly resilient. You gain the following benefits:

- **Hardened:** When you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, the minimum number you can roll is equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1).

- **Never Stay Down:** When you are reduced to 0 hit points while raging and don't die outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

- **Survivor's Stamina:** You can add your Constitution modifier to death saving throws.

### **CALCULATED FURY (14TH LEVEL)**

Beginning at 14th level, you've learned to channel your rage with deadly precision. While raging, you gain the following benefits:

- **Exploit Weakness:** Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you deal an extra 1d6 damage if you have advantage on the attack roll or if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it.

- **Battle Awareness:** You can take the Dodge action as a bonus action.

- **Professional's Instinct:** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and initiative rolls.

### **TIRVANDOR CONTEXT**

**Origin:** Border regions between Thaldros and Aethoria

**Culture:** These barbarians are professional survivors and mercenaries. They're respected in the Border towns for their effectiveness but feared for their brutality. Many are Iron Guild members.

**In Campaigns:**
- **Blood & Coin:** PERFECT - quintessential mercenary barbarian
- **Shattered Oaths:** Good - former reaver turned hero or antagonist

---

## PATH OF REVOLUTIONARY FURY (Barbarian)

*Aethorian freedom fighters who channel righteous rage against oppression and tyranny*

Some barbarians don't rage from bloodlust or primal fury—they rage from injustice. Revolutionary Fury barbarians are freedom fighters whose anger at tyranny and oppression fuels superhuman strength. They break chains, shatter walls, and inspire hope in the oppressed with their unstoppable wrath.

### **FURY OF THE OPPRESSED (3RD LEVEL)**

When you choose this path at 3rd level, your rage becomes a weapon against tyranny. You gain the following benefits:

- **Breaker of Chains:** While raging, you have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws to break objects, escape restraints, or force open doors and barriers. You deal double damage to objects and structures.

- **Tyrant's Bane:** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened. While raging, you are immune to being charmed or frightened.

- **Righteous Fury:** When you enter your rage, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet. Until your rage ends, you deal an extra 1d6 damage to that creature whenever you hit it with a weapon attack. This extra damage increases to 2d6 at 10th level and 3d6 at 14th level. The target should be one you perceive as an oppressor, authority figure, or enemy of freedom (DM's discretion).

### **INSPIRE RESISTANCE (6TH LEVEL)**

Starting at 6th level, your fury inspires others to resist. When you rage, you can choose a number of allies equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) within 30 feet of you who can see or hear you. Each chosen ally gains temporary hit points equal to your barbarian level and has advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed for the duration of your rage.

Once a creature gains temporary hit points from this feature, it can't gain them again until it finishes a short or long rest.

### **UNBREAKABLE WILL (10TH LEVEL)**

At 10th level, your commitment to freedom makes your spirit unbreakable. You gain the following benefits:

- **Freedom's Resilience:** While raging, you have resistance to psychic damage, and you are immune to any effect that would reduce your speed or restrain you.

- **Liberator:** You can use an action to attempt to free a willing creature within 5 feet of you from restraints, grapples, or magical effects that restrain or paralyze. Make a Strength check with a DC determined by the DM (typically DC 15 for mundane restraints, DC 20 for magical effects). On a success, the target is freed. While raging, you have advantage on this check.

### **REVOLUTION'S CHAMPION (14TH LEVEL)**

Beginning at 14th level, you become an avatar of revolutionary fury. You gain the following benefits:

- **Unyielding Rage:** While raging, you can't be knocked prone or moved against your will.

- **Shatter Oppression:** When you rage, you can choose to release a shockwave of revolutionary fury. Each creature of your choice within 10 feet of you must make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone. Structures and objects within this area take 4d6 force damage.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

- **Voice of Freedom:** You can use your action to rally allies. Each friendly creature within 30 feet of you that can hear you gains advantage on their next attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### **TIRVANDOR CONTEXT**

**Origin:** Aethoria (primarily), or former Thaldros slaves

**Culture:** Revolutionary Fury barbarians are heroes to the oppressed and terrorists to authorities. In Aethoria, they're celebrated freedom fighters. In Thaldros, they're hunted as dangerous rebels. Many have personal histories of slavery, imprisonment, or witnessing tyranny.

**Philosophical Note:** These barbarians believe freedom is worth any price. Their rage isn't mindless—it's the righteous anger of those who refuse to live in chains.

**In Campaigns:**
- **Blood & Coin:** Good - revolutionary turned mercenary, or hired to fight oppressors
- **Shattered Oaths:** EXCELLENT - perfect heroic revolutionary archetype

---

## DESIGN NOTES

**Balance Considerations:**

**Border Reaver:**
- Comparable to Berserker/Totem Warrior in power
- Scavenger feature is utility/flavor, not combat power
- Dirty Fighting is limited use but strong control
- Never Stay Down comparable to Relentless Rage (but different trigger)

**Revolutionary Fury:**
- Breaker of Chains is utility focused
- Righteous Fury comparable to Zealot's Divine Fury
- Inspire Resistance is support-focused (barbarian rarely does this)
- Shatter Oppression once per long rest keeps it balanced

**Flavor vs Mechanics:**
- Border Reaver: Practical, adaptable, professional
- Revolutionary Fury: Inspiring, freedom-focused, heroic

Both feel distinct from each other and from official barbarian paths!

**Next: Bard Colleges (College of Propaganda & College of the Iron Tongue)**


---

---

## COLLEGE OF PROPAGANDA (Bard)

*Masters of information warfare who wield words as weapons to shape public opinion and control narratives*

Whether serving a state or a revolution, bards of the College of Propaganda understand that controlling information is as powerful as any spell. They are masters of spin, manipulation, and mass persuasion, capable of turning friend to foe and hero to villain with carefully chosen words.

### **BONUS PROFICIENCIES (3RD LEVEL)**

When you join the College of Propaganda at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in Deception and Persuasion. If you are already proficient in either skill, you gain proficiency in another skill of your choice from the bard skill list.

You also learn Thieves' Cant, the secret language used to embed hidden messages in seemingly innocent conversation.

### **SPIN DOCTOR (3RD LEVEL)**

Also at 3rd level, you learn to reshape narratives and manipulate perception. You gain the following abilities:

- **Twist the Truth:** When you make a Charisma (Deception) or Charisma (Persuasion) check, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration to add the Bardic Inspiration die to your roll. You can wait until after you roll the d20 to decide.

- **Countermessaging:** When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes a Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Deception) check, you can use your reaction to expend one use of Bardic Inspiration and subtract the Bardic Inspiration die from their roll. You can wait until after they roll to decide.

- **Plant the Seed:** When you successfully deceive or persuade a creature, you can implant a false belief in their mind. The creature believes your lie or accepts your argument as unquestionable truth for 1 hour. If presented with obvious evidence contradicting the belief, they may question it (DM's discretion). Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### **PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN (6TH LEVEL)**

Starting at 6th level, you can launch coordinated information campaigns. Over the course of 1 hour (which can be during a rest), you can spread rumors, plant false information, or shape public opinion about a specific person, organization, or event.

Choose one of the following effects:

- **Smear Campaign:** Choose a creature known to the local population. For the next 24 hours, creatures in the settlement have disadvantage on Charisma checks made to aid or support that creature, and the target has disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks in the settlement.

- **Heroic Narrative:** Choose a creature known to the local population. For the next 24 hours, that creature has advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks in the settlement, and NPCs are predisposed to trust them.

- **Disinformation:** You spread a false but believable story. The DM determines the effects, but typically NPCs in the settlement believe the story unless presented with strong evidence to the contrary.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. The effects end early if you are revealed as the source of the propaganda.

### **INFECTIOUS RHETORIC (14TH LEVEL)**

At 14th level, your words can spread like wildfire through a population. You gain the following abilities:

- **Mass Manipulation:** When you cast a spell that charms a creature, you can target one additional creature within range for each level of the spell slot used (minimum of 1 additional target).

- **Fanatical Loyalty:** When a creature is charmed by you, it becomes fanatically loyal to you and your cause. It will defend your reputation, spread your message, and actively work to further your goals to the best of its ability. When the charm ends, the creature doesn't immediately realize it was magically influenced unless it acts completely contrary to its normal behavior.

- **Control the Narrative:** You can cast *modify memory* once without expending a spell slot. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### **TIRVANDOR CONTEXT**

**Origin:** Can serve either Thaldros (state propaganda) or Aethoria (revolutionary messaging)

**Culture:** 

**In Thaldros:** Propaganda bards are state-sponsored agents who control official narratives, suppress dissent, and shape public opinion in favor of the crown. They're well-paid but closely watched.

**In Aethoria:** Propaganda bards are revolutionary orators who spread messages of freedom, counter Thaldros propaganda, and inspire resistance. They're celebrated as heroes of the people.

**In the Border:** Some propaganda bards work as freelance spin doctors, selling their services to whoever pays.

**Moral Ambiguity:** This college is morally neutral—it's a tool that can be used for good (inspiring freedom) or evil (justifying tyranny). The bard's alignment matters more than the college itself.

**In Campaigns:**
- **Blood & Coin:** EXCELLENT - hired to manage a client's reputation or spread disinformation
- **Shattered Oaths:** Good - revolutionary propagandist or antagonist state agent

---

## COLLEGE OF THE IRON TONGUE (Bard)

*Border diplomats and contract specialists who broker deals and enforce agreements with magic*

The Iron Tongue bards are mercenary mediators affiliated with the Iron Guild. They are masters of negotiation, contract law, and deal-making who use magic to ensure agreements are honored. In the cutthroat world of Border mercenary work, their services are invaluable.

### **BONUS PROFICIENCIES (3RD LEVEL)**

When you join the College of the Iron Tongue at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in Insight and Persuasion. If you are already proficient in either skill, you gain proficiency in another skill of your choice from the bard skill list.

You also gain proficiency with calligrapher's supplies and learn to read and write legal contracts in multiple languages.

### **SILVER TONGUE (3RD LEVEL)**

Also at 3rd level, you become a master negotiator. You gain the following abilities:

- **Read the Room:** You can use a bonus action to make a Wisdom (Insight) check against a creature you can see. On a success, you learn the creature's current emotional state and whether it is lying. You also learn what it wants most in the current situation (gold, safety, revenge, etc.).

- **Compelling Offer:** When you make a Charisma (Persuasion) check to negotiate, broker a deal, or convince someone to accept terms, you can add your Bardic Inspiration die to the roll without expending a use of Bardic Inspiration. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

- **Detect Deception:** You have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks made to determine if someone is lying during a negotiation.

### **BINDING CONTRACT (6TH LEVEL)**

Starting at 6th level, you can create magically enforced contracts. When two or more willing creatures agree to terms you've negotiated, you can use an action to create a binding magical contract. The contract must be written down, and all parties must sign it (or make their mark).

The contract has the following properties:

- **Magical Enforcement:** All parties know immediately if another party breaks the terms of the contract. You are always aware when any term is violated, no matter the distance.

- **Compulsion:** When a party attempts to directly violate a major term of the contract, they must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = your spell save DC) or be unable to complete the action. This doesn't prevent indirect violations or creative interpretation.

- **Duration:** The contract lasts until its terms are fulfilled, all parties agree to void it, or you end it as an action. You can maintain a number of contracts equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).

- **Witness Protection:** You can sense the general direction and condition (alive, dead, healthy, wounded) of all creatures bound by your contracts within 1 mile of you.

### **IRON GUILD CONNECTIONS (6TH LEVEL)**

Also at 6th level, your affiliation with the Iron Guild grants you special privileges:

- You can identify other Iron Guild members on sight.
- You have advantage on Charisma checks when dealing with Iron Guild members.
- You can access Iron Guild safe houses, which provide free lodging and information about local mercenary work.
- You gain a +2 bonus to your Iron Guild reputation score (if using the reputation system from Blood & Coin campaign).

### **MASTER MEDIATOR (14TH LEVEL)**

At 14th level, you become legendary in the world of negotiation and deal-making. You gain the following abilities:

- **Legendary Negotiator:** When you roll initiative and aren't surprised, you can use your reaction to attempt to negotiate instead of fighting. Make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by the Wisdom (Insight) check of one creature that can hear and understand you. On a success, that creature and its allies will hear you out for 1 minute before combat begins. During this time, you can attempt to negotiate a peaceful resolution, bribe them, or convince them to leave.

- **Unbreakable Terms:** Contracts you create with Binding Contract become much more powerful:
  - Creatures that violate major terms take 4d10 psychic damage and suffer one level of exhaustion.
  - Creatures that violate minor terms take 2d10 psychic damage.
  - You can include a clause that teleports a creature to a designated location if they violate terms (the creature gets a Wisdom save to resist).

- **Arbitrator's Authority:** You can cast *geas* once without expending a spell slot, but only as part of a negotiated agreement where all parties consent. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### **NEW SPELL: IRON WORD**
*3rd-level enchantment*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a signed contract)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You speak a binding word of enforcement. Choose one creature within range that you have a contract with. That creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to honor the terms of your agreement. While affected, the creature has disadvantage on any action that would violate the contract and automatically fails Charisma (Deception) checks related to the contract terms.

**Bards of the College of the Iron Tongue learn this spell automatically at 3rd level, and it doesn't count against their spells known.**

### **TIRVANDOR CONTEXT**

**Origin:** Border regions, affiliated with the Iron Guild

**Culture:** Iron Tongue bards are respected neutral parties in the mercenary world. They broker contracts between mercenaries and clients, mediate disputes between rival companies, and ensure deals are honored. Their magical enforcement makes them invaluable—and wealthy.

**Reputation:** In the Border, an Iron Tongue bard's word is gold. They're trusted because breaking their contracts has severe magical consequences. Both Thaldros and Aethoria hire them for diplomatic missions when they need a guaranteed neutral party.

**Philosophy:** "Every person has a price, and every problem has a solution—if the terms are right."

**In Campaigns:**
- **Blood & Coin:** PERFECT - THE mercenary support class, contract specialist
- **Shattered Oaths:** Challenging but possible - neutral mediator in a world at war

---

## DESIGN NOTES

**Balance Considerations:**

**College of Propaganda:**
- Spin Doctor is powerful for social encounters but situational
- Propaganda Campaign is once per long rest and requires time
- Infectious Rhetoric is very strong but limited to charm spells
- Comparable power to College of Eloquence but with manipulation focus

**College of the Iron Tongue:**
- Silver Tongue is utility-focused, good for skill checks
- Binding Contract is powerful but requires willing participants
- Unbreakable Terms damage is comparable to other 14th level features
- Iron Word is a new spell but limited in scope

**Flavor vs Mechanics:**
- Propaganda: Mass manipulation, narrative control, psychological warfare
- Iron Tongue: Contracts, negotiation, magical enforcement, mercenary culture

Both provide strong social/utility options while remaining balanced for combat!

Additionally, undead that enter the area for the first time on a turn or start their turn there take 2d10 radiant damage.

**Divine Warrior: Guardian of Souls (6th Level)**

You can sense death approaching. When a creature within 30 feet of you would drop to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

Additionally, you can speak with the spirits of the recently dead. You can cast *speak with dead* without expending a spell slot. Once you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

**Ascended Avatar: Death's Guardian (17th Level)**

As an action, you can embody Mordain's eternal vigil. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:
- You can't be killed. If you drop to 0 hit points, you drop to 1 hit point instead. If you would die instantly, you don't.

## TIRVANDOR CONTEXT

**Origin:** Temples throughout Tirvandor, serving the Seven Ascended

**Culture:** Ascended Champions are elite warrior-priests, representing the most devout combat clerics in the faith. They're respected as living embodiments of their deity's ideals. Each of the Seven has their champions, and they're often called upon when martial might and divine magic are both needed.

**Selection:** Not every cleric of the Ascended becomes a Champion—it requires dedication to martial prowess as well as spiritual devotion. Many are former soldiers or paladins who took up the cloth.

**In Campaigns:**
- **Blood & Coin:** Good - mercenary priest, former chaplain, or hired divine warrior
- **Shattered Oaths:** Excellent - chosen champion for heroic deeds

---

## WAR CHAPLAIN DOMAIN (Cleric)

*Military clerics who serve as battlefield healers, morale officers, and spiritual guardians of armies*

War Chaplains are combat clerics attached to military units. Found in both Thaldros and Aethoria (and as mercenaries in the frontier), they bless troops before battle, heal the wounded in the thick of combat, and provide spiritual strength to soldiers facing death.

### **DOMAIN SPELLS**

| Cleric Level | Spells |
|--------------|--------|
| 1st | *bless*, *shield of faith* |
| 3rd | *aid*, *spiritual weapon* |

### **BATTLEFIELD BLESSING (1ST LEVEL)**

Also at 1st level, you can bless your squad before battle. When you cast a spell that restores hit points or grants temporary hit points to one creature, you can target one additional creature within 30 feet with the same spell (without expending an additional spell slot). You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### **CHANNEL DIVINITY: RALLY THE TROOPS (2ND LEVEL)**

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to bolster your allies' spirits. As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer of encouragement. Each friendly creature within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you gains temporary hit points equal to your cleric level + your Wisdom modifier and has advantage on their next attack roll or saving throw.

### **CHANNEL DIVINITY: GUARDIAN'S SACRIFICE (6TH LEVEL)**

Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to protect your squad at great personal cost. When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to take that damage instead. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way.

### **DIVINE STRIKE (8TH LEVEL)**

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

### **TIRVANDOR CONTEXT**

**Origin:** Military units in both Thaldros and Aethoria, mercenary companies

**Culture:**

**In Thaldros:** War Chaplains are official military positions, serving in every regiment. They're part of the command structure and report to both religious and military authorities.

**In Aethoria:** War Chaplains serve with militia units and People's Army regiments. They're more informal but no less dedicated, often volunteers from local temples.

**In the Border:** Mercenary companies hire War Chaplains to keep their soldiers alive and morale high. Iron Guild companies often have at least one on retainer.

**Philosophy:** War Chaplains believe that faith and fellowship in battle create unbreakable bonds. They're not pacifists—they understand that sometimes violence is necessary—but they honor the sacrifice of soldiers and try to minimize suffering.

**In Campaigns:**
- **Blood & Coin:** Excellent - mercenary chaplain, hired to keep soldiers alive
- **Shattered Oaths:** Excellent - military chaplain for heroic army

---

## DESIGN NOTES

**Balance Considerations:**

**Ascended Champion Domain:**
- Each variant is balanced against other martial cleric domains (War, Forge, Twilight)
- Divine Strike/Champion's Strike comparable to similar features
- Channel Divinity options are situationally powerful but not game-breaking
- 17th level features are capstones comparable to other domains

**War Chaplain Domain:**
- Strong support/healing focus
- Battlefield Blessing is powerful but limited uses
- Rally the Troops is strong but once per short rest
- Guardian's Sacrifice is risky but thematic
- Unyielding Faith is strong aura but appropriate for 17th level

Both domains provide strong martial + divine options for clerics!

**Next: Druid Circles (Circle of the Contested Lands & Circle of the Ascended Wild)**


---

---

## CIRCLE OF THE CONTESTED LANDS (Druid)

*Druids who protect the war-torn wilderness of the Border, adapting to any terrain and battlefield*

The lands between Thaldros and Aethoria have become a scarred, contested wilderness where armies march and nature suffers. Druids of this circle are neutral guardians who protect what remains of the wild, adapting to any terrain and using the very tools of war against those who would destroy nature.

### **CIRCLE SPELLS**

Your mystical connection to contested lands grants you access to certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells.

Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

| Druid Level | Circle Spells |
|-------------|---------------|
| 3rd | *alarm*, *expeditious retreat* |
| 5th | *pass without trace*, *spike growth* |
| 7th | *nondetection*, *conjure animals* |
| 9th | *freedom of movement*, *stoneskin* |

### **BATTLEFIELD ADAPTATION (2ND LEVEL)**

When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you can adapt to any battlefield. You gain the following benefits:

- **Terrain Sense:** You can spend 1 minute sensing your surroundings to detect the presence of military encampments, fortifications, or large groups of creatures (10+) within 1 mile. You learn their approximate direction and distance.

- **Scarred Beast Forms:** Your Wild Shape forms can reflect battlefield scars. When you use Wild Shape, you can choose to give your beast form one of the following traits:
  - **Battle-Scarred:** Gain temporary hit points equal to your druid level
  - **War-Wise:** Advantage on initiative rolls and can't be surprised
  - **Camouflaged:** Advantage on Stealth checks in natural terrain

- **Wasteland Stride:** Difficult terrain created by debris, rubble, or battlefield conditions doesn't cost you extra movement.

### **WAR-TOUCHED MAGIC (6TH LEVEL)**

Starting at 6th level, you can channel the harsh magic of contested lands. You gain the following abilities:

- **Scavenger's Instinct:** You can use your action to touch a weapon or piece of armor that has been on a battlefield. The item becomes magical for 1 hour, gaining a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls (weapon) or AC (armor). You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, regaining expended uses on a long rest.

- **Battlefield Harvest:** When you finish a short or long rest in a contested or war-torn area, you find useful materials. Roll 1d6: 1-2 (nothing), 3-4 (1d4 × 10 gp worth of supplies), 5-6 (one uncommon consumable magic item or component worth up to 100 gp).

### **CONTESTED GROUND (10TH LEVEL)**

At 10th level, you can transform an area into treacherous contested terrain. As an action, you cause a 30-foot radius area within 120 feet to become hostile terrain for 10 minutes. Choose one effect:

- **Entangling Debris:** The area becomes difficult terrain. Creatures that enter or start their turn there must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be restrained until the start of their next turn.

- **Hazardous Ground:** The area is filled with caltrops, broken weapons, and hazards. Creatures take 2d6 piercing damage when they enter or start their turn there.

- **Adaptive Wild Shape:** When you use Wild Shape, you can assume the form of beasts with CR up to 2 (instead of 1), and you can choose one additional trait from Scarred Beast Forms.

- **Neutral Ground:** You can cast *plant growth* without expending a spell slot. When you do, the area also becomes a sanctuary—creatures that enter must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to make attack rolls while in the area. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

- **War's End:** When you drop to 0 hit points in Wild Shape form, you can choose to have the beast form explode in a burst of primal fury. Each creature within 10 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d10 force damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. You then revert to your normal form.

### **TIRVANDOR CONTEXT**

**Origin:** Border wilderness, contested zones

**Culture:** These druids are lone guardians or part of small circles protecting specific regions. They're fiercely neutral, attacking any army (Thaldros or Aethoria) that threatens their lands. Both nations consider them dangerous obstacles.

**Philosophy:** "Nature endures. Empires fall. We remain."

**In Campaigns:**
- **Blood & Coin:** Good - neutral wilderness guide, hired protector
- **Shattered Oaths:** Good - protector of sacred groves in war zones

---

## CIRCLE OF THE ASCENDED WILD (Druid)

*Druids who serve Sylvara the Wild, embodying the primal fury and beauty of untamed nature*

While most druids honor nature generally, some dedicate themselves specifically to Sylvara the Wild, the most primal of the Seven Ascended. These druids embody her storm-touched fury and wild beauty, becoming avatars of nature's raw power.

  - At 10th level: Any beast of CR 2 or lower

### **CHANNEL SYLVARA (2ND LEVEL)**

Also at 2nd level, you can channel Sylvara's power. You gain two Channel Divinity options:

- **Wild's Fury:** As an action, you can cause nature to lash out. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 lightning or thunder damage (your choice) and is knocked prone. On a success, it takes half damage and isn't knocked prone.

- **Beast's Call:** As an action, you can summon spectral beasts to fight for you. You summon a number of beasts (from the *conjure animals* spell list) whose combined CR doesn't exceed 2. They appear within 60 feet, act on your turn, obey your commands, and last for 10 minutes.

You can use Channel Divinity twice between rests. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

### **STORM WALKER (6TH LEVEL)**

Starting at 6th level, you embody Sylvara's storm-nature. You gain the following benefits:

- **Lightning Step:** When you take the Dash action, you can teleport up to your speed instead of moving. When you appear, lightning strikes around you. Each creature within 5 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 lightning damage on a failed save.

- **Weather Sense:** You always know what the weather will be for the next 24 hours. You can cast *fog cloud* and *gust of wind* at will without expending spell slots.

At 14th level, you become the ultimate servant of Sylvara. You gain the following benefits:

- **Nature's Wrath:** You can cast *control weather* once without expending a spell slot. Once you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

- **Sylvara's Champion:** You have advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects. Beasts never willingly attack you.

### **TIRVANDOR CONTEXT**

**Origin:** Sacred groves dedicated to Sylvara, wild places

**Culture:** These druids are Sylvara's chosen servants, seen as her voice in the natural world. They're more aggressive than typical druids, viewing civilization's expansion as an affront to the Wild. They're revered by rangers and feared by loggers.

**Philosophy:** "The Wild is not gentle. Sylvara is not kind. We are her storm."

**In Campaigns:**
- **Blood & Coin:** Challenging - anti-civilization can conflict with urban jobs
- **Shattered Oaths:** Good - primal champion against corrupting forces

---

## DESIGN NOTES

**Balance:**

**Contested Lands:**
- Battlefield Adaptation provides utility and Wild Shape variety
- War-Touched Magic is flavor with moderate power
- Contested Ground is strong control, limited to short rest
- Guardian of the Border is strong but at 14th level

**Ascended Wild:**
- Sylvara's Blessing provides expanded beast options and resistance
- Channel Divinity gives druids more martial options
- Storm Walker is mobile and deals moderate damage
- Primal Embodiment is a powerful capstone

Both provide unique druid experiences tied to Tirvandor!

*Monks who escaped slavery or imprisonment, using martial discipline to resist oppression*

Monks of the Broken Chain learned their discipline in the worst circumstances—as slaves, prisoners, or captives. They use their ki to break bonds, resist control, and free others. Many come from Thaldros's prisons or labor camps, making them champions of freedom in Aethoria.

The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by spectral chains for 1 minute. While restrained, the target takes 2d8 force damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

**In Campaigns:**
- **Blood & Coin:** Good - hired to free captives, break into prisons
- **Shattered Oaths:** EXCELLENT - perfect freedom fighter archetype

## WAY OF THE COIN (Monk)

*Mercenary martial artists who blend ki mastery with calculated violence for profit*

Not all monks seek enlightenment—some seek gold. Monks of the Coin are pragmatic warriors who use their ki for mercenary work. They're professional fighters who've turned their martial discipline into a lucrative career, common in the Border's mercenary companies.

### **MERCENARY ARTS (3RD LEVEL)**

When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn to blend commerce with combat. You gain the following benefits:

- **Professional's Focus:** When you begin combat, you can designate one creature as your contract target. You deal an extra 1d6 damage to that target with your unarmed strikes and monk weapons. This lasts until the target drops to 0 hit points or combat ends.

- **Coin-Fueled Ki:** Whenever you spend at least 100 gp on yourself (equipment, training, luxuries, etc.) during downtime, you gain 1 additional ki point that lasts until expended or until you finish a long rest (maximum +3 ki points from this feature).

- **Calculated Strike:** When you hit with a Flurry of Blows attack, you can forgo one attack to study your opponent. You learn one of the following: their AC, their remaining hit points (approximate), one damage resistance, or one damage vulnerability.

### **BOUNTY HUNTER'S TECHNIQUE (6TH LEVEL)**

Starting at 6th level, you've mastered techniques for capturing and eliminating targets:

- **Non-Lethal Expert:** When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with an unarmed strike, you can choose to knock them unconscious instead of killing them. They're stable.

- **Marked for Gold:** You can spend 2 ki points to mark a creature you can see within 60 feet. For the next hour, you always know the direction and distance to the marked creature as long as it's on the same plane. The mark ends if you mark a different creature.

- **Mercenary's Speed:** You can spend 1 ki point as a bonus action to double your speed until the end of your turn, and opportunity attacks against you have disadvantage.

### **COIN'S BLESSING (11TH LEVEL)**

At 11th level, your mercenary success brings supernatural luck:

- **Gold-Touched:** When you have at least 1,000 gp on your person, you have advantage on Charisma checks and death saving throws. When you drop to 0 hit points, you can spend 500 gp (which is destroyed) to immediately stabilize at 1 hit point instead. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

- **Efficient Killer:** When you hit your contract target (from Professional's Focus), you can spend 2 ki points to force it to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it's stunned until the end of your next turn.

### **MASTER MERCENARY (17TH LEVEL)**

At 17th level, you become a legendary mercenary monk:

- **Assassin's Precision:** The extra damage from Professional's Focus increases to 2d6, and you score critical hits against your contract target on a roll of 18-20.

- **Coin Counter:** You have advantage on initiative rolls, and when you roll initiative, you can designate your contract target immediately without using an action.

- **Mercenary's Fortune:** At the start of each of your turns, if you have at least 1 ki point remaining, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus.

- **Payment in Blood:** Once per turn, when you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you gain 2 ki points (maximum 5 extra ki points per long rest from this feature).

### **TIRVANDOR CONTEXT**

**Origin:** Border mercenary companies, Iron Guild monasteries

**Culture:** These monks are professional fighters who view ki as a tool, not a spiritual path. They're respected in the Border as effective, reliable mercenaries. Some view them as sellouts; others as pragmatists.

**Philosophy:** "Enlightenment doesn't pay the bills. Excellence does."

**In Campaigns:**
- **Blood & Coin:** PERFECT - quintessential mercenary monk
- **Shattered Oaths:** Challenging - requires character growth from mercenary to hero

---

## DESIGN NOTES

**Balance:**

**Way of the Broken Chain:**
- Unbound Spirit provides utility and condition removal
- Resistance to Control is defensive and thematic
- Chains of Retribution flips oppression back on oppressors
- Avatar of Freedom is powerful capstone for liberation theme

**Way of the Coin:**
- Professional's Focus similar to Kensei's bonus damage
- Coin-Fueled Ki is flavorful and rewards mercenary lifestyle
- Bounty Hunter's Technique provides utility
- Master Mercenary is strong but appropriate for 17th level

Both provide unique monk experiences tied to Tirvandor!

**Next: Paladin (Oath of the Iron Crown & Oath of Liberty)**


---

---

## OATH OF THE IRON CROWN (Paladin)

*Paladins who serve Thaldros, enforcing law, order, and the king's will through strength*

Paladins of the Iron Crown are the armored fist of Thaldros. They swear to uphold law, maintain order, and enforce the king's authority. While some are noble protectors, others become instruments of oppression—their oath doesn't distinguish between justice and tyranny, only between order and chaos.

### **TENETS OF THE IRON CROWN**

The tenets of the Oath of the Iron Crown bind a paladin to the principles of law, order, and authority.

**Order Above All.** Chaos is the enemy. Law must be maintained at any cost.

**Obey Authority.** The king's word is law. Legitimate authority must be obeyed and protected.

**Strength Through Discipline.** Power comes from order and unity, not individual glory.

**Punish the Lawless.** Those who break the law must face justice swiftly and without mercy.

### **OATH SPELLS**

You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

| Paladin Level | Spells |
|---------------|--------|
| 3rd | *command*, *compelled duel* |
| 5th | *hold person*, *zone of truth* |
| 9th | *counterspell*, *dispel magic* |
| 13th | *banishment*, *compulsion* |
| 17th | *dominate person*, *hold monster* |

### **CHANNEL DIVINITY: VOICE OF AUTHORITY (3RD LEVEL)**

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following Channel Divinity options:

**Crown's Command:** As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity to speak with absolute authority. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet that can hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to obey a one-word command on its next turn (as per *command*). This affects any creature type.

**Enforce the Law:** As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity to mark a lawbreaker. Choose one creature within 60 feet that has broken a law you're aware of. For 1 minute, you have advantage on attack rolls against the target, and it has disadvantage on saves against your spells.

### **AURA OF ORDER (7TH LEVEL)**

Starting at 7th level, you emanate an aura of absolute discipline. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be charmed or frightened, and have advantage on saves to maintain concentration.

At 18th level, the range increases to 30 feet.

### **IRON JUDGMENT (15TH LEVEL)**

At 15th level, your strikes enforce the law itself. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can force it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, choose one:

- The target is paralyzed until the end of your next turn
- The target must tell the truth for the next minute (as *zone of truth*)
- The target is compelled to cease hostile action for 1 minute (it can defend itself but can't attack)

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### **AVATAR OF AUTHORITY (20TH LEVEL)**

At 20th level, you can assume the mantle of ultimate authority. As an action, you transform for 1 minute, gaining the following benefits:

- You emanate a 30-foot aura. Enemies in the aura have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.
- You have advantage on all Charisma checks and saving throws.
- When an enemy in your aura makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the roll (no limit).
- You can cast *command* at will without expending spell slots.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### **TIRVANDOR CONTEXT**

**Origin:** Thaldros royal paladins, trained in the capital

**Culture:** Iron Crown paladins are both revered and feared in Thaldros. They're symbols of the crown's power—defenders of order who can also be instruments of oppression. They enforce the law without question, making them heroes to law-abiding citizens and tyrants to rebels.

**Moral Complexity:** This oath is LAWFUL above all else, but not necessarily GOOD. An Iron Crown paladin might:
- Heroically defend citizens from bandits
- Ruthlessly suppress peaceful protests  
- Protect the innocent from criminals
- Hunt escaped slaves as "lawbreakers"

**The oath doesn't fall for enforcing unjust laws—it's about order vs chaos, not good vs evil.**

**In Campaigns:**
- **Blood & Coin:** Complex - former Iron Crown turned mercenary, questioning their oath
- **Shattered Oaths:** EXCELLENT - perfect antagonist OR defector seeking redemption

---

## OATH OF LIBERTY (Paladin)

*Paladins who champion freedom, break chains, and fight tyranny with righteous fury*

Paladins of Liberty are champions of the oppressed, breakers of chains, and living symbols of hope. They swear to fight tyranny wherever it exists, free the enslaved, and ensure all people can live without fear of oppression. They're heroes in Aethoria and criminals in Thaldros.

### **TENETS OF LIBERTY**

The tenets of the Oath of Liberty guide a paladin to fight for freedom and justice.

**Freedom is Sacred.** All beings have the right to be free. No chains are legitimate.

**Resist Tyranny.** Oppression must be opposed, regardless of the cost.

**Give Hope.** Be a beacon to the oppressed. Show them freedom is possible.

**Break the Chains.** Free those in bondage, whether physical, mental, or spiritual.

### **OATH SPELLS**

You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

| Paladin Level | Spells |
|---------------|--------|
| 3rd | *heroism*, *sanctuary* |
| 5th | *aid*, *lesser restoration* |
| 9th | *beacon of hope*, *remove curse* |
| 13th | *freedom of movement*, *guardian of faith* |
| 17th | *greater restoration*, *dispel evil and good* |

### **CHANNEL DIVINITY: LIBERATOR'S BLESSING (3RD LEVEL)**

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following Channel Divinity options:

**Break the Chains:** As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity to free yourself and allies. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet immediately ends all conditions affecting them (charmed, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, or restrained). Additionally, all restraints (magical or nonmagical) within the area break.

**Champion of the Oppressed:** As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity to become a beacon of hope. For 1 minute, you and allies within 10 feet have advantage on saves against being charmed or frightened, and you all gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your paladin level (minimum 1) at the start of your turn.

### **AURA OF FREEDOM (7TH LEVEL)**

Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be grappled or restrained, and your movement speed can't be reduced by magical means. Additionally, difficult terrain doesn't cost extra movement.

At 18th level, the range increases to 30 feet.

### **SMITE THE OPPRESSOR (15TH LEVEL)**

At 15th level, your divine strikes punish tyrants. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend a spell slot to deal additional radiant damage as per Divine Smite. If the target is an authority figure who oppresses others (slavers, tyrants, corrupt officials, etc.—DM's discretion), you deal the maximum damage for the Divine Smite instead of rolling.

Additionally, once per turn when you hit a creature that has another creature grappled or restrained, you deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage and can free the grappled/restrained creature.

### **REVOLUTIONARY ASCENDANCE (20TH LEVEL)**

At 20th level, you become the ultimate symbol of freedom. As an action, you transform for 1 minute, gaining the following benefits:

- You emanate bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light 30 feet beyond that.
- You and allies in the bright light have resistance to all damage and advantage on all saves.
- At the start of each of your turns, all conditions (charmed, frightened, paralyzed, etc.) end on you and allies in the bright light.
- When a creature starts its turn in the bright light, you can use your reaction to either heal it for 2d10 hit points or deal 2d10 radiant damage to it.
- Your weapon attacks deal an extra 2d8 radiant damage.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### **TIRVANDOR CONTEXT**

**Origin:** Aethoria (primarily), escaped slaves, revolutionary groups

**Culture:** Liberty paladins are living legends in Aethoria—symbols of resistance against Thaldros. They raid slave camps, protect refugees, and inspire revolutionary movements. Songs are sung about them. Children dream of becoming them.

**In Thaldros:** They're hunted as terrorists and traitors. Bounties on Liberty paladins are enormous.

**Philosophy:** "Every chain broken is a victory. Every freed soul is sacred. Every tyrant defeated is justice."

**In Campaigns:**
- **Blood & Coin:** Good - mercenary who fights for freedom (conflicted about payment)
- **Shattered Oaths:** PERFECT - THE heroic paladin archetype for this campaign

---

## DESIGN NOTES

**Balance:**

**Oath of the Iron Crown:**
- Voice of Authority provides control and marking abilities
- Aura of Order is strong defensive aura
- Iron Judgment is powerful control ability
- Avatar of Authority is extremely strong but appropriate for 20th level

**Oath of Liberty:**
- Liberator's Blessing provides condition removal and support
- Aura of Freedom prevents control effects
- Smite the Oppressor rewards targeting oppressors
- Revolutionary Ascendance is powerful protective capstone

**Thematic Contrast:**
- Iron Crown: Control, authority, enforcement
- Liberty: Freedom, protection, inspiration

These oaths represent the ideological conflict at the heart of Tirvandor!
