# Major Cities - Detailed Walkthroughs

## Kaer Thandros - The Mountain Fortress

### Approaching from the South Road

**3 Miles Out:**
The road climbs steadily through pine forest. Through gaps in trees, you catch glimpses of gray stone walls rising impossibly high up the mountainside. Smoke rises in dozens of thin columns—too organized to be natural. The sound of distant bells carries on the wind, marking the hour.

**1 Mile Out:**
The forest thins. The mountain dominates your view now. The city is built INTO it—you can see five distinct tiers of walls, each higher than the last, climbing the mountain face like a giant's staircase. The lowest walls are blackened in places. (Dragon fire from 1156 CR, if they ask.) 

Windows dot the mountain itself—thousands of them, carved directly into stone. At this distance, they look like a honeycomb. Smoke pours from vents near the base—the forges, working constantly.

The road widens, becomes paved with fitted stone. The first waystation appears: a fortified inn with walls of its own. Guards in black and iron watch travelers from the walls.

**The Gates:**
The outer gates are massive—forty feet high, twenty feet wide, made of iron-banded oak reinforced with mythril (it gleams silver in the cracks). The gates stand open during day, but you can see the murder holes above, the archer slits in the flanking towers, the oil channels that could turn this entrance into a death trap.

Guards check everyone entering. Not thoroughly—just enough to show they CAN. "State your business." They're professional, not friendly. They wear black tabards with a silver mountain sigil. Their armor is well-maintained. These are serious soldiers.

### The Outer City (First Tier)

**Entering:**
The gates open into a large courtyard—the Outer Market. It's paved with flat stones, worn smooth by centuries of boots. The smell hits you immediately: coal smoke, cooking food, horse dung, unwashed bodies, and underneath it all, the metallic tang of worked iron.

The buildings here are functional—three and four stories, stone and timber, with steep-pitched roofs to shed snow. Windows are small (keeps heat in during winter). Every building shows its purpose: tavern signs hang over doorways, smithy forges glow red through open doors, stable yards echo with horses.

**Architecture - Working Class:**
- **Materials:** Local gray stone for first floor, timber upper stories, slate roofs
- **Windows:** Small, shuttered (glass is expensive), covered with oiled cloth in cheaper buildings
- **Doors:** Heavy oak, reinforced (this is a military city—even civilians think defensively)
- **Decoration:** Minimal—maybe a carved lintel, painted shutters, house number in iron
- **Condition:** Well-maintained. No one lets their building rot in Kaer Thandros—it shows weakness

**Typical Street Scene - Outer City:**

You're walking down Armorer's Row. The street is twenty feet wide, paved with cobblestones. A gutter runs down the center, channeling water and waste to drains at the corners. The stones are worn smooth in the middle where cart wheels run.

Buildings rise on both sides, three stories tall. The ground floors are shops and workshops, all open to the street during business hours. Upper floors are housing—you can see laundry hanging from windows, flower boxes (surprisingly common), smoke rising from chimneys.

Every third or fourth building is a smithy. You can't miss them—forge glow spills from wide doorways, hammering echoes constantly, apprentices carry materials in and out. The heat radiates ten feet into the street. Master smiths' signs hang above doors: carved hammers, anvils, specific weapons.

Between smithies are support businesses: a charcoal merchant's warehouse, a leather worker (makes aprons and gloves), a tool maker, a cart wright. Everything needed to support the smithing trade.

People move with purpose. No one dawdles. Porters carry loads. Apprentices run errands. Customers inspect goods. City Watch patrols in pairs, hands on sword hilts, eyes scanning.

The noise is constant but organized: hammering, wagon wheels on stone, shouted conversations, street vendors crying wares. It's LOUD but rhythmic—the sound of industry.

**Random Detail Table - Outer City Streets:**
Roll d20 for specific details:
1. Street vendor selling hot meat pies, savory smell fills the air
2. Two dwarves arguing loudly in Dwarvish about metal quality
3. Apprentice runs past carrying glowing horseshoes on long tongs
4. Water cart passing, driver ringing bell, splashing street clean
5. Dog fight breaks out, owners pulling them apart, small crowd watching
6. Street preacher warning about dragon's return, mostly ignored
7. Child pickpocket working the crowd (DC 15 Perception to notice)
8. Merchant's wagon broken wheel, blocking traffic, people grumbling
9. City Watch checking a visitor's papers, questioning their business
10. Drunk soldier being escorted to guardhouse by his friends
11. Wedding procession passing, everyone stops to let them through
12. Funeral procession, citizens removing hats respectfully
13. Traveling merchant with exotic goods, drawing small crowd
14. Street musicians playing for coins, actually quite good
15. News crier shouting headlines, selling printed broadsides
16. Dwarf forgemaster examining apprentice's work, shaking head disapprovingly
17. Two nobles' carriages trying to pass each other, neither yielding
18. Market inspector checking weights and measures, merchant nervous
19. Fire brigade drill, volunteers practicing bucket chains
20. Street artist sketching portraits, small crowd watching

### The Forge District (Second Tier)

**Approaching:**
A wide ramp carved from the mountain itself leads to the second tier. The grade is steep enough that wagons need teams of four horses. Halfway up, there's a rest stop—a wide platform where wagons can pause, horses can drink from troughs fed by mountain springs.

At the top, gates again—smaller than the outer gates, but still formidable. The guards here are more selective. They ask more questions. "What business in the Forge District?" They check for obvious weapons. (Smiths' tools are fine. Battle-axes are questioned.)

**Entering the Forge District:**

The temperature rises immediately. This tier is noticeably warmer—all those forges pumping heat. The smell of hot metal is overwhelming. Soot drifts in the air like black snow. You taste metal on your tongue.

The sound is INCREDIBLE. Hundreds of hammers striking hundreds of anvils, not quite in unison but creating a rolling thunder of metalwork. Bellows whoosh. Quenching water hisses. Metals ring with different tones—you can actually hear the difference between iron and steel if you listen.

**Architecture - Craftsmen's District:**
- **Materials:** Almost entirely stone—fire risk too high for timber. Black basalt from local quarries.
- **Windows:** Wide doors and large windows for ventilation (forges need airflow). Shutters can seal tight at night.
- **Roofs:** Slate or tile, steep pitch, with smoke vents for forge chimneys
- **Decoration:** Master smiths display their best work outside—a sword mounted above door, an ornate gate, decorative ironwork
- **Condition:** Soot-stained but structurally perfect. These are valuable buildings—well-maintained

**Typical Street - The Hundred Hammers:**

This is the most famous street in the Forge District—a half-mile of smithies, packed together, all working simultaneously.

The street is wider here (thirty feet) to accommodate wagons carrying ore and coal. The cobblestones are discolored from soot—black and rust-red. Heat radiates from both sides. In winter, this street never has snow.

Each smithy is open to the street. You can see directly into workshops. The forge itself—a massive stone structure—dominates each shop. The fire glows orange-white. Apprentices work the bellows. The master smith stands at the anvil, hammer rising and falling with perfect rhythm.

Behind the master, the workshop extends back into the mountain—you can see racks of tools, quenching tanks, grinding wheels, workbenches. Some shops have windows into back rooms where detail work happens.

Above the workshops, housing for the master smith's family and apprentices. The windows here are smaller, shuttered. Flower boxes are common (surprisingly—even here, dwarves like gardens). Laundry hangs despite the soot.

Between smithies, essential services: a coal merchant's yard (mountains of black coal), a water seller (pure spring water for precise quenching), a metal merchant (ingots stacked in secure warehouses), a tool repair shop (even smiths' tools need maintenance).

The people here move with confidence. Everyone knows their role. Apprentices defer to journeymen, journeymen to masters, masters to guild wardens. There's a hierarchy, visible in how people interact.

**The Crown Forge - Special Location:**

At the end of the Hundred Hammers, the street opens into a plaza. At the far end stands the Crown Forge—unmistakable.

It's built directly into the mountain, facing the plaza. The entrance is forty feet high, carved from living rock, flanked by massive statues of dwarven forge-gods. Runes are carved everywhere—they glow faintly even during day, pulsing with inner light.

Heavy chains bar the entrance. Guards stand watch—not city guard, these are royal soldiers, wearing full plate armor despite the heat, standing absolutely still. They don't challenge observers, but hands rest on weapon hilts.

You can't see inside—the interior is dark. But you can FEEL it. The air around the Crown Forge feels different—heavier, charged with potential. Magic users sense power here. Everyone else just feels like they shouldn't get too close.

A sign warns: "Crown Forge - Royal Property - Authorized Personnel Only - Violators Will Be Prosecuted to the Full Extent of the Law."

Only a few times per year does smoke rise from the Crown Forge. When it does, the entire city knows. Something important is being made.

### The Deep Halls (Underground)

**Entering:**

Near the Forge District's center, a massive entrance descends into the mountain. This is the primary access to the Deep Halls—the dwarven quarter.

The entrance is a tunnel thirty feet wide, twenty feet high, carved perfectly smooth. Glowing fungi in glass containers provide light—green-blue bioluminescence that makes everything look slightly underwater. The temperature drops immediately—relief after the forge heat.

The tunnel slopes downward at a gentle angle. Every hundred feet, alcoves hold statues of dwarven ancestors—founders of clans, legendary kings, master craftsmen. Dwarves touch certain statues as they pass (prayer or respect, unclear which).

The walls are carved with reliefs showing dwarven history: the first delving, wars with underground creatures, great works of craftsmanship. Some carvings are ancient—pre-Sundering, impossibly old.

After several hundred feet, the tunnel opens into a vast cavern—the First Deep Hall.

**The First Deep Hall:**

Your eyes need time to adjust. The cavern is HUGE—you can barely see the ceiling, maybe three hundred feet up. Massive pillars hold the ceiling—natural stone columns, each carved with runes and decorated with reliefs.

Buildings line the cavern walls, carved directly from stone. They're not separate structures—they're sculpted from the cavern itself. Windows and doors are carved openings. Balconies are stone projections. Entire multi-story buildings, all one piece with the mountain.

Glowing fungi provides primary light—cultivated in gardens, hanging in baskets, growing on designated wall sections. The light is green-blue, makes everything ethereal. Some buildings have lanterns—warmer yellow light spilling from windows.

The floor is perfectly level, paved with fitted stones forming geometric patterns. Streets radiate from the hall's center like spokes from a wheel. Each street descends to deeper levels.

In the center of the hall, a marketplace. Stone stalls display goods: mushrooms (dozens of varieties), gems (raw and cut), metalwork (obviously), stone carvings, fungi-based products (food, medicine, paper).

The people here are mostly dwarves—moving confidently in their home. Humans walk carefully, looking around in wonder. The dwarves find this amusing but polite about it.

**Architecture - Dwarven Deep:**
- **Materials:** Carved stone. Everything is stone. Some buildings are 1,000+ years old, unchanged.
- **Windows:** Optional—internal rooms don't need them. Decorated with carved shutters even when windows aren't functional (aesthetic choice)
- **Doors:** Stone or iron, heavily carved, often decorated with family crests
- **Decoration:** EXTENSIVE—dwarves love carving. Every surface has patterns, runes, images. Centuries of work visible.
- **Condition:** Perfect. Stone doesn't rot. These buildings will stand forever.

**Temperature and Air:**
The temperature is constant year-round—cool but not cold, about 60°F. The air is fresh (ventilation shafts lead to surface). It smells of stone, mushrooms, and lamp oil.

### The Royal Quarter (Highest Tier)

**Approaching:**

The road to the Royal Quarter is steep, winding, and very obviously monitored. Guards at checkpoints. Patrols visible on walls. This is not a public area—you need business here.

The architecture changes. Buildings are larger, better maintained, more decorated. Stone is whiter (expensive limestone shipped from elsewhere). Roofs are copper (weathered to green) or gold-leafed (yes, actual gold). Gardens appear—improbable at this altitude, requiring massive effort to maintain.

**The High Street:**

The main street through the Royal Quarter is wide enough for two carriages to pass comfortably—forty feet. It's paved with white limestone, kept spotlessly clean. Servants sweep it daily.

Buildings rise four and five stories, each one a noble estate. They're walled—high stone walls with iron gates. You can see gardens beyond, fountains, statuary. Guard houses flank each gate.

The architectural style is mixed—each noble house shows their heritage. Dwarven houses are squat, heavily carved, with deep foundations. Human houses are taller, with towers and spires. Elven houses (few) incorporate living trees impossibly.

Servants are everywhere—running errands, maintaining properties, carrying messages. They wear house colors, making loyalty visible. They move purposefully, eyes down, not engaging.

The street is QUIET compared to lower tiers. No hammering, no shouting vendors, no crowds. Conversations happen in low voices. Carriages roll quietly on smooth stone.

**Noble Estate - Example (House Ironmark Residence):**

A massive iron gate, fifteen feet high, decorated with the Ironmark crest—crossed hammers over an anvil. Two guards in house colors (black and bronze) stand watch. They're alert, professional, well-armed.

Beyond the gate, a courtyard paved with black basalt. A fountain in the center—bronze dragons spilling water into a basin. Flowerbeds (despite altitude) showing meticulous care.

The house itself is three stories, built from gray granite with bronze fixtures. The style is distinctly dwarven—heavy, solid, built to withstand siege. Windows are narrow, defensible. The roof is bronze-plated.

The main door is bronze, twenty feet high, carved with scenes of legendary smithing. It weighs literal tons but opens smoothly (perfect engineering).

Inside (if you're allowed in), everything is high-quality but understated. Stone floors with precision joints. Plastered walls painted in earth tones. Furniture is solid wood, expertly crafted. Tapestries show house history. Display cases hold weapons and armor made by family masters.

It's wealthy but not ostentatious. The wealth is in QUALITY, not flash.

## Silverpine - The Forest City

### Approaching from the East Road

**5 Miles Out:**
The Silverwood begins gradually. First, regular forest—oak, pine, beech. Then you notice the trees are larger. Older. The forest feels... aware. Not threatening (unless you threaten it) but conscious.

Bird calls echo. Wind through leaves sounds almost musical. Light filters green through the canopy. The road is hard-packed dirt, well-maintained but not paved (deliberate choice—paving offends the forest).

Elven ranger outposts watch from the trees. You won't see them unless they want to be seen. But you feel watched.

**2 Miles Out:**
The silver birch trees appear. Their bark literally gleams like polished silver. These are OLD—pre-Sundering, possibly older. They're massive—trunks twenty feet across, rising three hundred feet.

The road narrows. Trees grow close. Their branches form a natural arch overhead. Light comes in dapples—silver-green. The air smells of pine sap, flowers, old magic.

Waymarkers appear—carved stones showing distance to city. The carvings are beautiful, unnecessary—art for art's sake. Very elven.

**The Border:**
No wall. No gate. Just a line of silver birches, slightly denser than the forest. A wooden arch spans the road—carved from one piece of ancient wood, decorated with leaves and vines.

Elven rangers step from the trees. They're not threatening—they're welcoming, actually. "Welcome to Silverpine." Their accent is musical. They ask your business politely. They check for iron weapons (forbidden in the forest—iron disrupts nature magic). They offer to "hold" iron items until you leave (they'll actually return them).

Beyond the arch, the city begins.

**But you can't see it yet.**

### Entering Silverpine

The road continues through silver birch forest. Buildings start appearing, but they're subtle—built into and around trees, using natural materials, painted in forest colors. You could walk past and not realize they're there.

The "ground level" of Silverpine is primarily for visitors—humans, traders, non-elves. The real city is above, in the canopy.

**Ground Level - The Market Ground:**

The forest opens into a clearing—maybe three hundred feet across. This is the Market Ground, the heart of human/elf interaction.

Buildings here are more conventional (for human comfort). Stone foundations, timber walls, shake-shingle roofs. But they're built AROUND trees, not destroying them. A building might have a tree growing through its center, emerging from the roof.

The plaza is paved with fitted stones, worn smooth. Market stalls form a circle around the central Heart Tree (a silver birch so massive you can't see the top—it disappears into canopy).

Architecture - Market Ground:**
- **Materials:** Local stone, oak timber (sustainably harvested), living wood (shaped, not cut)
- **Windows:** Large, filled with real glass (elven craft—perfect clarity)
- **Doors:** Carved wood, each one unique, telling a story
- **Decoration:** Extensive but natural—carved vines, leaves, animals, all blending with forest
- **Condition:** Perfect maintenance. Nothing rots. Magic preserves.

**Typical Scene - Market Ground:**

It's midday. The Market is busy. Humans outnumber elves here—this is "their" space.

Stalls display goods: elven crafts (wooden bowls so smooth they gleam, woven baskets of impossible intricacy), forest products (rare herbs, mushrooms, perfect lumber), exotic goods (elven wine, moonsilver jewelry, star-charts).

Humans shop carefully. Everything here is expensive. Quality is extraordinary, but so are prices.

Elves move through the crowd gracefully. They're polite, helpful, slightly distant. They answer questions patiently. They don't haggle—prices are fixed. "The item is worth what it's worth."

The Heart Tree dominates the plaza. Its trunk is sixty feet across. Silver bark gleams. Carved symbols cover the lower trunk—prayers, blessings, historical markers. Elves touch the tree as they pass (reverence, habit, greeting—unclear which).

Around the plaza, permanent buildings: inns (The Silver Stag is finest), trading houses, exchange offices, customs house (where iron is held), guide services (hiring rangers to travel the forest).

The smell is flowers and clean air. No sewage smell (elven sanitation is excellent—everything is composted or channeled to treatment plants). No smoke (minimal fires—elves prefer magical light).

The sound is quieter than human cities. Conversations in Common, Elvish, occasionally Dwarvish. Bird songs. Wind in leaves. Water flowing (streams run through the city). No hammering, no wagon wheels, no shouting vendors.

**The Customs House:**

At the plaza's edge, a stone building with elf guards. This is where iron weapons are surrendered.

Inside, shelves of confiscated items—swords, axes, knives, all iron. Each has a wooden tag. The room smells of metal and oil.

The elf clerk is polite but firm. "Iron disturbs the forest's harmony. We'll keep it safe. Here's your token." The token is carved wood, unique pattern, impossible to forge. You get your weapon back when you leave.

They don't confiscate steel (steel is refined iron—less magically disruptive). Enchanted weapons are evaluated case-by-case.

### The Canopy City (Upper Levels)

**Accessing the Canopy:**

Stairs spiral up tree trunks. They're grown from the trees—living wood, shaped over decades, steps merging seamlessly with bark. The stairs are steep, narrow, with no railings (elves don't fear heights—everyone else should).

Alternative: Platforms raised by vines. Stand on platform, speak the password (in Elvish), vines lift you gently upward. Safer but slower. Mostly for heavy goods.

Adventurous types: Climbing (DC 15 Athletics). Locals won't stop you, but they'll judge your technique.

**The Canopy:**

Two hundred feet up. The world transforms.

You're standing on a wooden platform, sixty feet across, suspended between three silver birch trunks. Vine railings provide safety. Other platforms visible in all directions—dozens, hundreds, connected by bridges.

The bridges are woven vines, reinforced with wooden planks, swaying gently in the wind. They're stronger than they look (can support tons) but walking on them feels precarious. Elves cross without looking down. Visitors grip the railings.

Buildings here are shaped from living wood—grown over decades, pruned and trained, resulting in structures that are part tree, part house. Walls are seamless wood. Windows are shaped openings. Roofs are leafy branches.

Everything sways slightly in the wind. This is normal. The city moves with the trees.

**Architecture - Canopy Level:**
- **Materials:** Living wood, shaped and trained, still growing
- **Windows:** Open (no glass needed—climate control through natural magic)
- **Doors:** Grown from the structure, opening inward, fitted perfectly
- **Decoration:** Natural—the wood grain is decoration enough, but elves carve details: leaves, vines, animals
- **Condition:** Living—repairs itself, grows stronger over time

**Typical Scene - Canopy Residential:**

You're crossing a vine bridge, heading toward a residential cluster. The bridge sways gently. Below, you can see the forest floor—far below. Green leaves above, green forest below, you're in between.

The residential platform ahead has six houses. Each is shaped from a different tree, unique. Some are round (grown from a circular branch pattern), others angular (deliberately pruned for geometric shapes).

Elves move between houses casually. Children play on the platforms (horrifying—there are no railings in some places, children run along branch-edges fifty feet from the next level). No one seems concerned.

Flowers grow everywhere—in boxes, hanging baskets, climbing vines. The colors are incredible—reds, purples, yellows, all natural, attracting butterflies and hummingbirds.

The view is spectacular. Between trees, you can see forest extending to horizon. Other platforms and buildings dot the canopy like a city in the clouds.

The sound is wind through leaves, bird calls, distant elven voices singing. Elves sing while working, for pleasure, as communication. It's beautiful and slightly haunting.

**The Star Chamber - Specific Location:**

At the highest level, two hundred and fifty feet up, an open platform with no roof—the Star Chamber.

It's circular, eighty feet across, with carved railings showing constellations. The platform is perfectly level (impressive at this height). The wood is ancient, worn smooth by centuries of use.

By day, it's a meeting place. Elves gather here to discuss, debate, decide. There's no formal government building—decisions happen here, in the open.

By night, it's an observatory. Elves lie on the platform, watching stars. They track constellations, predict events, maintain connection to their astronomical heritage.

The view at night is INCREDIBLE. No light pollution (elves use minimal artificial light). Stars blanket the sky. The Milky Way is a river of light. On clear nights, you can see the aurora (even this far south—magic makes it visible).

Standing here at night, wind in your hair, stars overhead, forest below, you understand why elves built this city.

## Goldreach - Maritime Majesty

### Approaching from the Land Road

**10 Miles Out:**
The forest gives way to rolling hills. Farmland appears—wheat fields, vineyards, olive groves. The air changes—you can smell salt now, carried on the sea breeze.

The road improves—becomes paved with fitted stones. This is a major trade route, well-maintained. Milestones mark distance. Guard posts at intervals (this close to the city, bandits are rare, but presence deters).

**5 Miles Out:**
From a hilltop, you see the sea—brilliant blue, stretching to horizon. And there, where land meets water, Goldreach.

The city is white. Limestone buildings, red tile roofs, cascading down hills to the harbor. The harbor is massive—hundreds of masts, a forest of ships. Sun glints off brass fixtures, glass windows, golden domes.

Even at this distance, it looks wealthy.

**The Harbor Approach (If Arriving by Sea):**

Far more dramatic.

The lighthouse appears first—the Lighthouse of Eternal Flame, standing on a rocky outcrop two hundred feet tall. The flame at top burns with golden light (alchemical fire—never goes out). At night, it's visible for fifty miles.

As you approach, the harbor opens before you—enormous, protected by stone breakwaters, with docks extending like fingers into the water. Ships of all sizes crowd the harbor—fishing boats, merchant vessels, naval warships, exotic ships from distant lands.

The city rises in tiers behind the harbor. Each tier is a distinct color—the lower docks are weathered gray wood, the middle markets are white stone, the upper estates are golden in sunlight.

Flags fly everywhere—ship flags, house banners, harbor signal flags. The colors create a festival atmosphere.

The smell reaches you before you dock—salt, fish, tar, spices, and underneath it all, the distinctive smell of money.

### The Docks (Lower District)

**Arriving at the Docks:**

You step off the gangplank onto the wharf. The planks are wide, solid, worn smooth by boots and cargo. They're damp from constant spray. Everything here is slightly damp and salty.

The harbor is LOUD. Ship crews shouting in a dozen languages. Dock workers calling orders. Gulls screaming. Water slapping hulls. Cargo cranes creaking. It's organized chaos.

**Architecture - Dock District:**
- **Materials:** Weathered wood (oak, teak), iron fittings (constantly repainted against rust), stone foundations where possible
- **Windows:** Small, shuttered (storm protection), covered with oiled canvas instead of glass
- **Doors:** Wide (cargo needs access), reinforced with iron bands
- **Decoration:** Ship figureheads, maritime symbols, carved mermaids, fishing nets as decoration
- **Condition:** Weathered but functional. Salt air ages everything quickly, but structures are solid.

**Typical Wharf Scene:**

You're standing on Pier Seven (they're numbered). The pier is thirty feet wide, four hundred feet long, extending into the harbor. Ships dock on both sides.

To your left, a merchant vessel is unloading—exotic cargo from across the Sundering Sea. Dock workers (licensed, wearing guild pins) carry crates down gangplanks. A customs inspector checks manifests. Harbor guards watch for smuggling.

To your right, a fishing boat is selling its catch directly to buyers. The smell of fresh fish is overwhelming. Buyers examine fish critically, haggling in rapid-fire patois (mix of Common and Elvish trade-tongue).

Behind you, warehouses line the wharf. Each is numbered, owned by different merchant houses. Doors are wide, guarded. Inside, you glimpse stacked cargo—crates, barrels, bundles.

Between warehouses, support businesses: a rope seller (coiled rope everywhere), a sail maker (canvas hanging to dry), a ship's chandler (supplies for crews), a bucket shop (yes, buckets—ships need lots).

The people here are diverse—every race, every nation. Sailors from Aethoria with pointed ears and strange accents. Dwarven engineers checking ship hulls. Human merchants negotiating loudly. Halfling dock workers (surprisingly strong for their size). Even the occasional tiefling or half-orc.

Everyone's busy. No one's friendly (unless you're buying). Everyone's trying to make money or trying not to lose money.

**Random Detail Table - Harbor Docks:**
Roll d20:
1. Drunk sailor singing shanties, mostly on-key
2. Street urchin offering to "watch your stuff" (protection racket)
3. Fresh catch just landed—fish being gutted, scales everywhere
4. Ship's captain hiring crew, promising "easy voyage, good pay" (both lies)
5. Harbor patrol checking papers, taking suspicious person away
6. Cargo crate breaks open, exotic goods spilling out
7. Two merchants arguing over damaged goods, voices rising
8. Street vendor selling grilled fish on sticks, smells amazing
9. Dock worker fell in water, friends laughing while he climbs out
10. Foreign ship arriving, exotic design, crowd gathering to watch
11. Ship's cat has caught a rat, proudly displaying kill
12. Dock collapsed nearby, being rapidly repaired
13. Smuggler being chased by customs officers, dodging through crowd
14. Street preacher warning sailors about drinking and vice (ignored)
15. Old sailor telling sea stories, small crowd listening
16. Ship departure imminent, last-minute loading frenzy
17. Customs auction of confiscated goods, bidding energetic
18. Harbor master shouting orders through speaking trumpet
19. Exotic animal in cage being transported, drawing attention
20. Fight breaks out, quickly broken up by harbor guards

### The Merchant's Row (Middle District)

**Ascending:**

Wide stone stairs climb from the docks to the second tier. The stairs are worn—millions of feet over centuries. Vendors line the stairs selling water, refreshments, newspapers.

At the top, the architecture transforms.

**Merchant's Row:**

The streets here are thirty feet wide, paved with white limestone, swept clean. No garbage. No animal droppings. Private maintenance crews keep everything spotless.

Buildings are three and four stories, built from limestone blocks. The style is elegant—arched windows, balconies with iron railings, red tile roofs. Each building displays wealth without ostentation.

Ground floors are merchant houses—offices, showrooms, meeting halls. Upper floors are residences or additional offices. Everything is secure—iron-bound doors, barred windows at street level, guards in house colors.

**Architecture - Merchant District:**
- **Materials:** White limestone (imported, expensive), marble columns (status symbol), brass fittings (polished constantly)
- **Windows:** Large, real glass (clear, not cloudy), with iron shutters for storms
- **Doors:** Oak reinforced with iron, elaborate locks, often carved with house crests
- **Decoration:** Moderate but tasteful—carved stonework, painted shutters, mosaic entrances
- **Condition:** Immaculate. Appearance matters in business.

**Typical Scene - Merchant's Row:**

You're walking down the main avenue—officially "Commerce Street" but everyone calls it Merchant's Row.

Merchant houses line both sides. Each displays their specialty: painted signs, carved symbols, displayed goods. A spice merchant's building smells of cinnamon and cloves. A textile house has silk samples draped in windows. A banking house is deliberately plain (security through discretion).

Well-dressed merchants move between buildings. They wear fine clothes—silk, velvet, carefully tailored. Not noble (no house crests) but wealthy. They carry leather portfolios, have clerks following with documents.

Hired guards are everywhere. Each merchant house employs security—retired soldiers mostly, wearing house colors, armed with swords and crossbows. They stand by doors, walk with merchants, never relax.

Carriages roll past occasionally—covered, pulled by matched horses, expensive but not ostentatious. Inside glimpses of wealth—cushioned seats, curtained windows.

The street smells clean—rain-washed stone, flower boxes in windows, distant sea air.

The sound is quieter than the docks—conversations in low voices, horses' hooves clicking, distant harbor noise. Business happens behind closed doors.

**The Exchange - Specific Building:**

At the street's center, a building larger than the rest—the Exchange.

It's built like a temple—marble columns, stone steps, bronze doors. The architecture is deliberately imposing—this is where fortunes are made and lost.

Inside (if you enter), a massive hall with vaulted ceiling. The floor is marble, echoing footsteps. In the hall's center, the trading floor—a raised platform where prices are called out.

Merchants gather around the platform, shouting bids. A huge board displays current prices—wheat, lumber, iron, exotic goods, ships' shares. Prices change constantly, clerks updating the board.

The noise is intense—merchants shouting, clerks calling orders, runners carrying messages. The smell is paper, ink, sweat, money.

Around the trading floor, private booths where deals are closed. Merchants meet here, documents are signed, fortunes transfer.

Security is tight. Guards everywhere. No weapons allowed. Clear bags required (preventing concealed items). They don't want violence disrupting business.

### The Heights (Upper District)

**The Final Climb:**

The road to the Heights is steep—too steep for wagons. Stairs carved into hillside, switchbacking upward. Private sedan chairs carry wealthy residents (carried by four strong men—expensive service).

**The Heights:**

The architecture here is residential—mansions and estates, each occupying entire blocks.

High walls surround properties. Gates are iron, guarded. You can see gardens beyond—fountains, statuary, manicured lawns (impossibly expensive this close to sea).

The buildings themselves are two and three stories, built from finest materials—marble, rare woods, slate roofs. Each is unique—different architects, showing family style.

**Architecture - The Heights:**
- **Materials:** Marble (status symbol), exotic woods (imported), bronze and gold fixtures (actual precious metal)
- **Windows:** Large, floor-to-ceiling on ocean side (views), filled with perfect glass, curtained heavily (privacy)
- **Doors:** Carved mahogany, sometimes with gold inlay, always guarded
- **Decoration:** Extensive—statuary, mosaics, frescoes, everything custom
- **Condition:** Perfect. Armies of servants maintain these estates.

**Goldshore Palace:**

At the highest point, overlooking everything—the Goldshore Palace.

It's not subtle. Three stories, sprawling, built from white marble that catches sunlight and glows. Golden domes top the towers (actual gold leaf—1,000 pounds of gold on the roofs). Crystal windows. Bronze gates.

The grounds are twenty acres—gardens, fountains, private docks (yes, private ocean access), guest houses, guard barracks.

The message is clear: Goldshore is wealthy beyond measure, and they want everyone to know it.

## Sundara - The Desert Jewel (Detailed)

### Approaching Through Desert

**Last Oasis Before City (20 Miles Out):**
The desert is brutal. Sand stretches in all directions. Heat radiates from the ground. Mirages shimmer on the horizon.

But you know Sundara is ahead—the caravan routes are well-marked with stone cairns every mile. Bleached bones line the path (camels, horses, occasionally human—desert takes its toll).

**10 Miles Out:**
Green appears on the horizon. It's not mirage—it's real. Palm trees. Twelve massive palms, visible from miles away (each representing one of the subsidiary oases).

The sand changes color—from yellow to reddish to almost white as you approach. Different types, different properties. Locals can tell where they are by the sand.

**The Oasis Gates:**
Sundara has walls—adobe and stone, twenty feet high, white-washed. Guard towers at intervals. The gates are wide (caravans need access), carved with geometric patterns, reinforced with bronze bands.

Guards check everyone entering. Not hostile—welcoming, actually. "Welcome to the City of the Sun." They verify you're not bringing anything forbidden (weapons are fine, certain drugs are not, disease quarantine is strict).

Beyond the gates—green, water, life.

### The Great Oasis (City Center)

**First Impression:**
The temperature drops fifteen degrees. You're standing in shade—palm fronds overhead creating natural canopy. The air smells of water, flowers, life.

The Great Oasis stretches before you—a pool of crystal-clear water, perfectly circular, maybe fifty feet across. It's deep—you can see down at least thirty feet, where water bubbles up from underground springs.

Around the oasis, the twelve ancient palms—massive, hundreds of years old, their trunks three feet across. Fruit hangs from branches. Children climb like monkeys, harvesting dates.

Buildings ring the oasis in concentric circles. The inner ring is all adobe—traditional construction, whitewashed, domed roofs, arched doorways. The outer rings add stone and timber.

**Architecture - Sundara:**
- **Materials:** Adobe (sun-dried mud bricks), white plaster, stone foundations, tile roofs
- **Windows:** Small, high (keeps heat out), covered with carved wooden screens (mashrabiya—allows air flow, blocks direct sun)
- **Doors:** Thick wood, often decorated with brass studs and geometric carvings
- **Roofs:** Flat or slightly domed, white-plastered (reflects heat), with gardens on some
- **Courtyards:** Every building has internal courtyard (private, cooler, protected from sand)
- **Decoration:** Tile mosaics (blues, greens, yellows), carved plaster, geometric patterns (no figural art—religious tradition)

**Typical Scene - Oasis Plaza:**

It's midday (hottest part of day). The plaza is less crowded than morning or evening—smart people rest during midday heat.

But there's still activity. Water carriers fill clay jars from the oasis—there's a designated filling area, watched by guards. Water theft is serious crime.

Children play in shallow pools at oasis edge. Women wash clothes (designated washing area, downstream from drinking water). Men gather in shade, drinking tea, discussing business.

Market stalls ring the plaza—canvas awnings providing shade. Vendors sell: dates (dozens of varieties), figs, olives, spices, cloth, leather goods, glass work (Sundara's famous product).

The smell is complex—water, flowers, spices, cooking food, animals (camels tied at edges), humanity.

The sound is musical—Arabic-style, with different language rhythms. Water splashing. Children laughing. Merchants calling wares in sing-song. Prayer calls from minarets five times daily (melodic, beautiful even if you don't understand words).

**The Glass Bazaar - Specific Location:**

East of the main plaza, a covered market—the Glass Bazaar.

The roof is canvas, dyed in colors, creating kaleidoscope light. Supporting poles are carved wood. The floor is packed earth, swept clean.

Every stall displays glass—Sundaran glasswork is famous. You see:
- Bottles in every color (cobalt blue, emerald green, ruby red, amber, clear)
- Windows (colored glass, perfectly clear glass, textured glass)
- Jewelry (glass beads, impossibly delicate)
- Art (blown glass sculptures, some large as a person)
- Practical items (drinking glasses, bowls, pitchers)
- Decorative panels (geometric patterns, light-catching)

The craftsmanship is extraordinary. Some pieces are thin as paper, strong as iron. Others incorporate gold leaf, making them glow. Some change color in different light.

Glassblowers work in the bazaar—you can watch them shape molten glass, breathing life into sand. The furnaces glow orange. The heat is incredible (even in a desert, noticeable).

Prices are high. Quality is worth it. Sundaran glass is exported across both continents.

## Marshaven - The Swamp City (Detailed)

### Approaching Through Swamp

**5 Miles Out:**
The solid ground ends. Water begins—not ocean, not river, just... water. Murky, brown, warm. The Thornmire Marches.

The path becomes a causeway—wooden planks on stilts, barely wide enough for a cart. Swamp water laps at the planks. Things move in the water (fish? Alligators? Best not to look).

Cypress trees rise from water, draped with moss. The canopy is thick—light filters green. The air is humid, warm, smells of decay and growth simultaneously.

Bird calls echo—herons, cranes, things you can't identify. Insects swarm (bring repellent). The water makes constant sounds—dripping, splashing, mysterious.

**2 Miles Out:**
Buildings appear on stilts—isolated homesteads, watch posts, ranger stations. People wave from porches. Some fish from their houses directly.

The causeway branches—multiple paths through swamp. Signs mark routes: "Marshaven Main," "Fisher's Path," "Lizardfolk Quarter." Navigation is critical—wrong turn means lost in swamp.

**The City Gates (Such As They Are):**
There's no wall. How do you wall swamp? Instead, a checkpoint—wooden platform, guards in canoes, marking the city boundary.

They check for disease (swamp diseases are serious). They warn about water safety ("Don't drink brown water. Don't swim. Don't feed the gators."). They offer guides if needed.

Beyond, the city appears—impossibly.

### Marshaven Streets (Walkways)

**The Stilt City:**
Buildings rise on stilts—twenty feet above water. Everything is vertical. The "streets" are wooden walkways connecting buildings—narrow, maybe four feet wide, with rope railings.

The walkways sway slightly. Water flows beneath. Looking down is discouraged if you're afraid of heights.

**Architecture - Marshaven:**
- **Materials:** Cypress wood (rot-resistant), bamboo (flexible), thatch (roofs), rope (everything tied together)
- **Stilts:** Cypress poles driven deep into swamp bottom, treated with pitch
- **Platforms:** Wooden decks, slatted (water drains through)
- **Walls:** Woven bamboo, some with mud plaster
- **Roofs:** Thatch (palmetto fronds, needs replacing every few years)
- **Decoration:** Carved posts, painted symbols, bone decorations, practical not ornate

**Typical Scene - Main Walkway:**

You're walking the central walkway—the widest in city, maybe six feet across, with railings on both sides.

Buildings line both sides—stilted structures, each unique. Some are residential (laundry hanging, children playing on platforms). Some are shops (goods displayed on porches). Some are communal (gathering halls, cooking areas).

People move confidently—locals never fall. Visitors grip railings, move slowly. Lizardfolk SWIM beneath walkways (they enjoy the water).

Below, boats navigate between stilts—canoes mostly, some rafts, propelled with poles. It's faster to boat than walk sometimes.

The smell is swamp—earthy, organic, mushroomy, with cooking food and wood smoke mixed in.

The sound is unique—water lapping wood, walkways creaking, boats splashing, frogs croaking (constant), insects buzzing, voices echoing across water.

**Random Detail Table - Marshaven:**
Roll d20:
1. Lizardfolk emerges from water carrying fresh fish
2. Child falls off walkway, surfaces laughing, climbs back up
3. Alligator visible in water, locals unconcerned ("That's Old Snapper, he's friendly")
4. Fisherman pulls up eel, fighting to control it
5. Rain starts suddenly, everyone continues normally (rain is constant)
6. Boat collision below walkway, owners arguing about right-of-way
7. Swamp gas bubble pops, brief foul smell
8. Heron lands on railing, eyes you, flies away
9. Net full of crawfish being hauled up, dinner tonight
10. Someone playing musical instrument, haunting melody
11. Laundry falls in water, owner cursing, fishing it out
12. Elderly person feeding fish from porch, meditative
13. Children jumping between platforms, showing off
14. Herbalist displaying swamp plants, explaining medicinal use
15. Snake slithers across walkway, everyone steps over casually
16. Bog witch's apprentice selling potions from canoe
17. Lost visitor asking directions, getting conflicting answers (locals find this funny)
18. Lizardfolk eggs being carefully transported
19. Storm approaching, people securing boats, closing shutters
20. Fireflies emerging at dusk, magical effect

### The Lizardfolk Quarter

**Different Architecture:**
The buildings here are half-submerged—designed for people who breathe air but love water.

Structures have upper platforms (dry) and lower areas (submerged). Lizardfolk move between levels freely. It's like aquatic apartments.

**The Sun Rocks:**
A sacred area—flat rocks (natural stone, rare in swamp) where lizardfolk bask.

There's always lizardfolk here, lying in sun, soaking heat. They're not unfriendly—wave to you, invite you to sit (though you can't bask like they can).

The rocks are warm—sun-heated stone, comfortable. The view is good—you can see across swamp. It's peaceful—lizardfolk don't talk much while basking.

**The Egg Pools:**
Nearby, warm pools where lizardfolk lay eggs. The pools are magically heated (geothermal? Magic? Unclear). The temperature is perfect for eggs.

This area is guarded. Lizardfolk are protective of eggs. You're allowed to visit (respectfully) but touching anything is very bad idea.

The pools glow faintly at night (bioluminescent algae). It's beautiful—green light reflecting off scales, water, surrounding trees.

## Village Descriptions (Detailed Examples)

### Oakenheart Village (The Silverwood)

**Population:** ~320 (mixed human and elf)

**Approaching:**
You're walking through the Silverwood. The Heart Oak appears gradually—first as a massive presence ahead, then as an impossible tree dominating the sky.

The tree is 500 feet tall, 60 feet across at base. Silver-green bark. Branches spread like a natural cathedral. You can see the village built around its base—a ring of buildings, radiating like spokes from a wheel.

**Village Layout:**
The Heart Oak is center. Eight roads radiate outward like star points. Buildings fill the spaces between roads.

Everything is built to face the tree—respect, reverence, practical (tree provides shade, shelter, protection).

**Architecture - Oakenheart:**
- **Materials:** Oak timber (sustainably harvested with druid permission), stone foundations, thatch roofs
- **Style:** Mix of human practical and elf elegant—function with beauty
- **Windows:** Carved shutters (elf influence), real glass in wealthy homes
- **Doors:** Heavy oak, each unique, many carved with oak-leaf patterns
- **Decoration:** Wood carvings everywhere, nature motifs, both cultures contributing

**The Heart Oak Itself:**
The trunk is so wide you can't see around it. The bark is rough, ancient, covered in moss and climbing vines.

Carved into the bark: prayers, blessings, initials, dates going back centuries. Elves touch the tree reverently. Humans do too (adopted the custom).

At the base, an opening—natural hollow, large enough for a small shrine inside. The village shrine to nature gods, tended by druids.

The roots are massive—rising from ground, creating natural benches, hollows, archways. Children play on the roots. Old folks sit on them. Everyone gathers here.

**Typical Scene - Oakenheart:**

It's market day. The main square (really just cleared space at tree base) fills with stalls.

Human farmers sell vegetables, eggs, cheese—practical food. Elf artisans display woodwork—bowls, spoons, carvings of exquisite quality. Half-elf crafters sell both styles.

The mixing is visible everywhere—human children playing with elf children. Mixed couples shopping together. Conversations switching between Common and Elvish mid-sentence.

The village elder (human) walks past, greeted respectfully. The druid elder (elf) sits by the tree, meditating. Both are authorities, neither superior.

A wedding arch stands ready—mixed wedding this afternoon (human groom, elf bride). Everyone's invited. These weddings unite the community.

The Heart Oak's leaves rustle though there's no wind. Locals pause, look up. "The tree speaks." No one can explain what it says, but everyone hears something.

**The Crisis (Current):**
The tree is dying. Recent visitors notice immediately:
- Leaves falling prematurely (it's spring—shouldn't happen)
- Bark darkening in patches
- Fewer acorns producing
- The "voice" quieter

Locals are terrified but hiding it. Too proud to ask for outside help, but desperate. If the tree dies, what happens to the village? The treaty between humans and elves? The magic that protects the area?

Three children born the night the tree stopped growing are now teenagers. They're somehow connected to the tree—they feel its pain, hear its thoughts. They might be the key.

### Bogwallow Village (Thornmire Marches)

**Population:** ~250 (mostly human, some halfling)

**Approaching:**
This village is deep in the swamp. No causeways lead here—you need a guide. The water is darker here, the trees thicker, the insects more aggressive.

The village appears suddenly—stilted buildings emerge from mist. They're built low, close to water, deliberately concealed. This is a village that doesn't want to be found.

**Why So Hidden:**
Bogwallow was founded by refugees, criminals, escaped slaves, people with reasons to hide. That was 200 years ago, but the tradition continues. Questions about past are rude here.

**Architecture - Bogwallow:**
- **Materials:** Whatever's available—driftwood, salvaged timber, scavenged materials
- **Stilts:** Shorter than Marshaven (only 10 feet high), thicker
- **Buildings:** Rougher, patchwork, functional not beautiful
- **Roofs:** Thatch (thick layers—rain protection critical)
- **Walkways:** Minimal—people use boats more than walking
- **Decoration:** None—survival matters more than aesthetics

**Village Layout:**
There's no organized layout. Buildings cluster randomly. Walkways connect them haphazardly. It's maze-like (deliberately—harder for outsiders to navigate).

The only "public" space is The Muck Inn—a building twice the size of others, the community gathering point.

**The Muck Inn:**
A building on thick stilts, with covered porch on three sides. Inside, a common room—rough tables, benches, a bar made from a massive log.

The proprietor (Big Martha, 60s, human, tough as nails) serves swamp whiskey (homemade, powerful, questionable legality), fish stew (surprisingly good), and judgment (free).

This is where villagers gather, share news, conduct business, settle disputes. Big Martha enforces rules—no killing in the inn, no starting fights you can't finish, pay your tab.

**Typical Scene - Bogwallow:**

It's evening. Most villagers are at The Muck Inn.

The crowd is rough—scarred faces, practical clothing, weapons within reach. Everyone eyes strangers carefully. You're assessed immediately—threat? Opportunity? Leave them alone?

Conversations are guarded. No one asks personal questions. If you volunteer information, they listen. Otherwise, silence.

Boats are tied to inn stilts—escape routes, everyone ready to vanish into swamp if necessary. It's not paranoia—it's survival instinct.

The smell is harsh—swamp water, wood smoke, fish cooking, strong alcohol, unwashed bodies (bathing is difficult in swamp).

The sound is muted—quiet conversations, no shouting, awareness that sound carries in swamp.

**What Bogwallow Offers:**
- **Hiding:** No questions asked, no authorities here
- **Supplies:** Basic—food, rope, boats, nothing fancy
- **Information:** Smuggling routes, safe passages, who's looking for who
- **Skills:** Residents include—herbalists, trackers, guides, people who "fix problems"
- **Access:** Bogwallow guides know swamp paths no one else knows

**Village Economy:**
- Peat harvesting (swamp moss fuel)
- Fishing (catfish, eel, crawfish)
- Herb gathering (medicinal and... other kinds)
- Guiding (for those who can pay)
- "Discrete services" (smuggling, hiding people/goods)

### Frostholm Village (The Frostmarches)

**Population:** ~280 (90% human, some dwarf)

**Approaching:**
You're traveling north. The temperature drops steadily. Trees become sparse—pine and fir, growing twisted from wind. Snow covers everything, even in summer.

Frostholm appears as smoke columns against white landscape. The buildings are dark against snow—deliberately painted dark (absorbs heat).

**The Cold:**
This is COLD. Real cold. "Freeze to death in minutes if unprepared" cold. Everyone wears furs, multiple layers. Exposed skin is dangerous.

**Architecture - Frostholm:**
- **Materials:** Timber (only option), stone foundations, thick walls (two layers with insulation)
- **Roofs:** Steep pitch (snow slides off), heavy timber
- **Windows:** Small (heat loss), shuttered, some with ice-filled frames (ice insulates better than air somehow)
- **Doors:** Double doors (airlock effect), inner and outer
- **Heating:** Central fire pits, shared walls (buildings clustered for warmth)
- **Decoration:** None—survival priority

**Village Layout:**
Buildings cluster in a tight circle around central longhouse. Covered walkways connect buildings (walking outside in blizzards is deadly).

The circle is defensive—against wind, against cold, against threats (giants, wolves, worse things from north).

**The Longhouse:**
The village center—a building 100 feet long, 30 feet wide, 20 feet high at the peak.

Inside: one massive room. Central fire trench runs the length (always burning—fire goes out, everyone dies). Smoke vents through holes in roof.

Benches line walls. Sleeping alcoves built into walls (curtained for privacy). Storage lofts overhead.

This is where the village gathers—eating, socializing, sleeping (during worst cold). It's communal living by necessity.

**Typical Scene - Frostholm:**

It's evening. Everyone's in the longhouse—outside is death.

The fire blazes. It's too hot near the fire, too cold away from it. People arrange themselves by preference.

Dinner is cooking—seal meat, fish, dried vegetables (fresh vegetables are memories). The smell is strong—meat, smoke, bodies, dogs (sled dogs live here too).

Conversation is loud (competing with wind outside, fire crackling). Topics are practical—weather, hunting, supplies, threats.

Children play near the fire—roughhousing, making noise. Old folks sit in prime spots (earned through survival). Adults work—repairing gear, making clothing, maintaining tools.

Outside, wind screams. Snow batters walls. Everyone ignores it—this is normal.

**Village Economy:**
- Ice fishing (through ice, all winter)
- Seal hunting (primary food source)
- Fur trapping (survival and trade)
- Fishing (brief summer)
- Trading post (supplying expeditions north)

**What Makes Frostholm Special:**
The northern lights. On clear nights, they dance across the sky—green, blue, purple curtains of light, impossible beauty in frozen wasteland.

Recently, the lights have been... wrong. Wrong colors. Wrong patterns. Wrong timing. Old folk say something's coming from the north. They're scared, and they're hard to scare.

---

### Creating Atmosphere:

**Sensory Layers:**
- Primary: What they see (most important)
- Secondary: What they hear (second most important)
- Tertiary: What they smell (powerful for memory)
- Quaternary: What they feel (temperature, texture, air)
- Rare: What they taste (only when relevant)

**Show Don't Tell:**
❌ "The city is wealthy"
✅ "Gold leaf covers the dome. Servants sweep the street constantly. Carriages have cushioned seats."

**Contrast:**
Show different areas. Rich district vs. poor district. Day vs. night. Fair weather vs. storm. Makes locations dynamic.

**Consistency:**
Reference previous descriptions. If the docks smelled of fish yesterday, they smell of fish today. Players notice inconsistency.

### Avoiding Info Dumps:

**Reveal Gradually:**
Don't describe everything at once. Reveal as players explore. They see more as they investigate.

**Player Focus:**
Describe what interests them. They're shopping? Describe shops. They're investigating? Describe suspicious details.

**Natural Discovery:**
Let players ask questions. Answer what they'd notice. Don't volunteer everything.

# Additional Major Cities - Detailed Walkthroughs

## Ironhold - The Northern Guardian

**Population:** ~8,000 (60% human, 25% dwarf, 15% other)

### Approaching from the South

**2 Miles Out:**
The Northern Pass narrows between two peaks. The road becomes more deliberately fortified—stone walls on both sides, watchtowers every quarter mile, cleared fields of fire. This isn't just a road; it's a killing ground.

Ironhold itself comes into view—a massive fortress built into the pass itself, blocking the entire valley. The walls rise 60 feet high, black iron-bound stone that looks like it grew from the mountain. Behind the first wall, you see a second wall. And behind that, a third. This place is designed to never fall.

**1 Mile Out:**
You pass through the first checkpoint—a fortified gatehouse with murder holes, ballista emplacements, and troops who question everyone. Thoroughly. They check papers, inspect cargo, ask your business. The soldiers are professional, experienced, and suspicious of everyone.

Beyond the first gate, you're in a corridor between two walls. Nowhere to go but forward. Archer slits line both sides. This is a trap for invaders—you've entered but you're not inside yet.

**The Main Gates:**
The gates of Ironhold are legendary—steel reinforced with mythril, 50 feet high, 30 feet wide, 8 feet thick. When they close (and they do close—every night, without exception), nothing is getting through.

The gate guards wear full plate armor even in peacetime. Their tabards show a black iron tower on gray field. They're the elite—Northern Guard, hand-picked soldiers who've proven themselves in combat.

### The Outer Ward

**Entering:**
Through the gates, you enter a courtyard that's really a parade ground. It's massive—300 feet across, perfectly flat, paved with flagstones. This is where the garrison musters for inspection.

The air smells of steel, leather oil, and sweat. The sound is military—boots on stone, barked commands, weapons practice from the training yards. Even civilians here move with purpose—no one dawdles in a military fortress.

**Architecture - Outer Ward:**
- **Materials:** Dark gray granite, black iron fittings, slate roofs
- **Design:** Function over form—every building serves a purpose
- **Windows:** Narrow slits in barracks, wider in officer quarters, shuttered and barred
- **Decoration:** Minimal—regimental standards, unit crests, nothing frivolous
- **Condition:** Immaculate—maintenance is constant, damage repaired immediately

**Typical Street Scene - Outer Ward:**

You're walking down the main thoroughfare—it's called "The Spine." It's 40 feet wide, perfectly straight, running from outer gates to inner gates. The cobblestones are regulation-laid, forming geometric patterns.

Both sides are lined with barracks—three-story stone buildings, identical in design. Ground floor is armory and equipment storage. Second floor is sleeping quarters (bunks for 40 soldiers each). Third floor is officers' rooms and planning spaces.

Between every three barracks is a support building: a smithy (repairing weapons and armor), a quartermaster's depot (supplies stacked with military precision), a bathhouse (mandatory cleanliness), a chapel (dedicated to Thoran the Shield).

Soldiers move in small groups—never alone, always in unit formations. They salute officers automatically. They yield right-of-way to supply wagons. They don't loiter or gather in large groups.

The noise is regimented: morning bells at dawn, drilling from training yards, hammering from smithies, marching cadence from patrol changes. Even chaos is organized.

**Random Detail Table - Ironhold Streets:**
Roll d20:
1. Unit in full armor running formation drills, counting cadence
2. Weapons inspection in progress, officer examining blade quality
3. New recruits struggling through obstacle course, sergeants shouting
4. Armorer fitting custom piece for officer, taking measurements
5. Supply wagon unloading, soldiers forming chain to move goods
6. Courier running with urgent message, everyone clearing path
7. Injured soldier being carried to infirmary, comrades marching alongside
8. Target practice on archery range, arrows thudding into targets
9. Blacksmith shoeing war horses, animals stamping and snorting
10. Officer reviewing guard rotation, checking duty roster
11. Religious service in progress at chapel, somber hymns audible
12. War dogs being exercised, handlers keeping tight control
13. Engineer unit repairing wall section, working methodically
14. Intelligence officer questioning a prisoner in courtyard
15. Messenger pigeons arriving at coop, soldier logging messages
16. Commander inspecting troops, soldiers at rigid attention
17. Civilian contractor selling supplies, haggling with quartermaster
18. Healer treating minor injuries in field clinic
19. Guard change ceremony, formal and precise
20. Alarm drill—soldiers rushing to battle stations

### The Inner Fortress

**Approaching:**
A second set of gates—smaller but thicker—leads to the inner fortress. These gates are closed except when specifically opened. Guards here know everyone by sight. Strangers are escorted.

**Inside:**
The inner fortress is tighter, more cramped. Buildings are built directly into the mountain. Windows are minimal. Everything feels underground even when it's not.

This is where officers live, where strategy happens, where the real power resides. The air is warmer (heated by volcanic vents channeled from deep below). The light is dimmer (fewer windows, more torches).

**The Command Tower:**

The heart of Ironhold—a tower built into the mountain peak, rising 200 feet above the fortress floor. From the top, you can see 50 miles in every direction.

Inside, it's a spiral of stone stairs, war rooms on every level. Maps cover every wall. Couriers run constantly. Officers plan, debate, strategize.

The commander's office is at the very top. Sparse furnishings—a desk, chairs, weapon racks. The walls are maps and reports. The view is everything—you can see why they chose this place. Nothing approaches unseen.

**What Ironhold Offers:**
- **Security:** Safest place in the north
- **Training:** Military training for hire (expensive)
- **Intelligence:** Information about northern threats
- **Supplies:** Military-grade equipment (if you have authorization)
- **Healing:** Combat medics (field medicine, efficient but painful)

**Social Structure:**
Rank matters here more than anywhere else in Tirvandor. Military ranks are observed strictly. Civilians are tolerated but not equal. The commander's word is law.

**Why Players Might Come Here:**
- Investigating reports of giant activity
- Seeking military aid for a threat
- Learning combat skills from veterans
- Accessing intelligence reports
- Hiding from pursuit (under military protection)

## Crossvale - The Five Roads Hub

**Population:** ~18,000 (65% human, 20% halfling, 10% dwarf, 5% other)

### Approaching from Any Direction

**3 Miles Out:**
You see Crossvale before you reach it—not the buildings, but the roads. Five major trade routes converge here, and from a distance, they look like spokes on a wheel, all pointing to one center.

The roads are impressive—30 feet wide, paved with fitted stone, with drainage ditches on both sides. Milestones every quarter-mile. Waystations every five miles. This is serious infrastructure, maintained by serious money.

Traffic increases steadily. You're joining a river of commerce—merchant wagons, caravan trains, mounted messengers, traveling merchants with pack mules, peasants driving livestock to market.

**1 Mile Out:**
The walls come into view. Crossvale is FORTIFIED—30-foot walls of gray stone, 15 feet thick at the base. Five gates—one for each road—with fortified gatehouses, flanking towers, murder holes, the works.

This is a city that expects trouble. During the War of Three Kingdoms (1180-1186), Crossvale changed hands four times. Everyone wanted to control the crossroads. The current walls were built afterward—they learned their lesson.

**The Gates:**
Each of the five gates has the same design: double portcullis, outer courtyard (a kill zone), inner gates. But each is named and decorated differently:

- **North Gate (Ironward):** Decorated with mountain symbols, handles traffic from Kaer Thandros
- **South Gate (Sunward):** Desert motifs, traffic from Sundara
- **East Gate (Seaward):** Maritime themes, traffic from Goldreach
- **West Gate (Forestward):** Woodland carvings, traffic from Silverpine
- **Center Gate (The Crown):** Finest decoration, ceremonial entrance

Guards at each gate check cargo (looking for contraband and assessing tariffs). The checking is thorough but professional. They've seen everything—be honest, pay your tariffs, move on.

### The Merchant District (The Hub)

**Entering:**
The five roads meet in a massive circular plaza—The Grand Circle—500 feet in diameter, paved with colored stones forming a compass rose pattern. This is the heart of Crossvale.

The plaza is controlled chaos. Merchants have stalls arranged in concentric circles. Goods from across Tirvandor are here: spices from the south, furs from the north, crafts from the east, lumber from the west. The noise is incredible—hundreds of merchants shouting, buyers haggling, goods being loaded and unloaded, animals protesting, street performers competing for attention.

The smell is everything at once: spices, leather, unwashed bodies, cooking food, animal dung, perfume, wood smoke. It's overwhelming until you adjust.

**Architecture - Merchant Quarter:**
- **Ground Floor:** Wide fronts open to the street, display windows, heavy shutters (closed and locked at night)
- **Materials:** Mixed—stone first floor (fire safety), timber or brick upper floors, tile roofs
- **Second Floor:** Business offices, counting houses, storage
- **Third Floor:** Merchant family living quarters
- **Fourth Floor:** Servant quarters, additional storage
- **Decoration:** Wealthy merchants display wealth—carved facades, painted plasterwork, guild symbols in iron

**Typical Street Scene - The Counting Quarter:**

You're on Silver Street—one of the primary merchant streets radiating from The Grand Circle. It's 40 feet wide with raised sidewalks on both sides (keeps pedestrians separate from wagon traffic).

The buildings here are substantial—four stories, well-maintained, decorated but not gaudy. Ground floors are offices and showrooms. Large windows with glass panes display expensive goods. Signs hang above doors—carved wood with gold leaf, showing the merchant house name and symbol.

During business hours (dawn to dusk), the street is busy. Clerks run between offices carrying ledgers. Merchants meet to negotiate deals. Money changers operate from small shops (heavily guarded). Porters move goods. Everything is business.

The people here dress well—merchants in quality clothing (showing status but not flaunting), clerks in neat but simple tunics, guards in house colors (every major merchant employs guards).

**The Marketplace - The Grand Circle:**

The center of everything. During market hours (dawn to dusk, every day), it's packed.

The outer ring (closest to the street) is food vendors: bread, meat, vegetables, prepared food. The smell is incredible. Customers buy lunch, dinner, snacks. Street performers work this ring—musicians, jugglers, storytellers.

The middle ring is specialty goods: cloth merchants, leather workers, tool sellers, pottery, basketry. Quality goods at fair prices. Customers browse, compare, haggle.

The inner ring (closest to the center) is luxury goods: jewelry, fine cloth, exotic spices, rare books, art. Higher prices, wealthier customers, more selective vendors.

The very center is the Burgher's Platform—a raised stone dais where the city council makes announcements, where public declarations are read, where judgments are pronounced.

**Random Detail Table - Crossvale Market:**
Roll d20:
1. Price war between competing merchants, undercutting each other loudly
2. Exotic goods from distant lands drawing crowd, strange smells
3. Street magician performing tricks, pickpocket working the audience
4. Market inspector checking weights, merchant caught cheating
5. Caravan arriving, travel-stained merchants unloading goods
6. Street preacher warning about greed, mostly ignored by merchants
7. Noble's servant shopping with list, vendors competing for attention
8. Children running errands for families, dodging through crowds
9. Foreign merchant with language barrier, using gestures to haggle
10. Rival merchant houses having shouting match over territory
11. Street artist doing quick portraits, long line of customers
12. Exotic animal being led through, crowd parting nervously
13. Wedding party shopping for celebration, merchants offering discounts

16. Guild representative collecting dues, ledger in hand
17. Tourist obviously lost, locals giving contradictory directions
18. Musician with trained monkey, collecting coins in cup
19. News crier selling broadsides, shouting headlines
20. Merchant celebrating successful deal, buying drinks for crowd

### The Warehouse District

**Located:** South and west of center, closer to walls

**Purpose:** Storage. Crossvale is a distribution hub—goods arrive, get stored, get redistributed. The warehouses make it work.

**Architecture - Warehouses:**
- **Size:** Massive—some 200 feet long, 100 feet wide, 40 feet high
- **Materials:** Stone first floor (fire safety, security), timber upper floor (lighter load)
- **Doors:** Huge double doors, reinforced, multiple locks
- **Windows:** Minimal, high up (security)
- **Special Features:** Loading docks, pulley systems for moving goods, night guards

**Street Scene - Warehouse Quarter:**

It's quieter here than the market. The streets are wider (need room for wagons). The buildings are functional, not decorative.

During the day, it's active—wagons loading and unloading, porters moving goods, clerks checking inventories, guards watching everything. The work is physical and constant.

At night, it's locked down tight. The guards don't sleep—warehouse fires and thieves are constant threats. They patrol in pairs, carrying lanterns, watching shadows.

### The Guildhalls

**Located:** North of Grand Circle, prestigious district

**Purpose:** Each major trade guild has a hall here—their headquarters, meeting place, showcase.

**Architecture - Guildhalls:**
These are statements of power and wealth. Each guild tries to outdo the others.

- **Merchant's League:** Largest hall, four stories, marble façade, gold leaf decorations
- **Wagoneer's Guild:** Massive stable attached, vehicle displays
- **Banker's Guild:** Fortified like a castle, vaults deep underground
- **Innkeeper's Guild:** Operates as demonstration inn, finest example of hospitality
- **Artisan's Guild:** Each craft has their best work displayed outside

**Social Structure:**

Crossvale runs on money and connections. Status comes from wealth, guild membership, and political influence. The burgher council (wealthy merchants) effectively rules. The nominal lord is a figurehead.

**What Crossvale Offers:**
- **Trading:** Anything can be bought or sold here
- **Information:** Merchants know everything traveling the roads
- **Banking:** Major banking houses with international connections
- **Lodging:** From flophouses to luxury inns
- **Contracts:** Caravan guard work, trading opportunities
- **Contacts:** Everyone passes through eventually

**Why Players Visit:**
- Trading goods or acquiring supplies
- Following trade routes to investigate something
- Meeting contacts (everyone stops in Crossvale)
- Guarding caravans for income
- Investigating trade-related crimes (smuggling, fraud)

## Ashgate - City of Fire and Stone

**Population:** ~12,000 (55% human, 20% dwarf, 15% genasi-fire, 10% other)

### Approaching from the West

**5 Miles Out:**
The landscape changes gradually. Vegetation thins. The ground becomes rocky, volcanic soil. The air tastes of sulfur. You see steam vents in the distance—white plumes rising from the earth.

The temperature rises. Even in winter, it's warm here. In summer, it's oppressive. Travelers shed layers, drink more water, move slower.

**2 Miles Out:**
The volcanic region becomes obvious. Black stone everywhere—obsidian outcroppings catching sunlight, basalt cliffs, pumice fields. The ground is cracked in places, revealing red-orange glow beneath (lava flows, barely cooled).

Ash drifts in the air—not thick enough to choke, but present. It coats everything. Buildings in the distance look black and gray. Your skin feels gritty.

Ashgate itself appears—a city of black stone against gray ash. The walls are obsidian—not carved, but built from massive blocks of volcanic glass. The effect is alien, beautiful, and intimidating.

**The Gates:**
The gates are iron—heavy black iron that doesn't corrode in the volcanic atmosphere. They're decorated with flame motifs—not painted, but forged into the metal itself, glowing faintly red (enchanted to be always warm, never hot enough to burn).

Guards wear lightweight armor—full plate is too hot here. They favor chain mail with cloth underneath, face scarves against ash, goggles against volcanic glare. Their tabard shows a black tower with red flames—the city symbol.

### The Outer City - The Ashward

**Entering:**
Through the gates is a courtyard—but it's not paved with stone. It's natural volcanic rock, smooth where lava flowed and cooled. The surface is uneven, wavy, frozen mid-flow. In places, you can see where lava filled in patterns, creating natural art.

The smell is distinct—sulfur (not overwhelming, you adjust), hot stone, charcoal, and underneath it, the metallic tang of worked obsidian.

The sound is unique—volcanic glass has a different resonance when struck. The whole city has a crystalline quality to its acoustics. Voices carry strangely. Footsteps on obsidian sidewalks make a different sound than stone.

**Architecture - Ashward:**
- **Materials:** Obsidian blocks (lower wealth), basalt stone (middle class), pumice brick (lighter, upper stories)
- **Roofs:** Fired clay tiles (everything else would warp in heat), steep pitch (ash slides off)
- **Windows:** Small (keep heat out during day), shuttered, no glass (too hot—ash cloth instead)
- **Doors:** Wood with metal fittings (wrapped in cloth during ash storms)
- **Special:** Every building has ash catchers (roof features to collect and divert ash)
- **Color:** Black, gray, red—natural volcanic palette

**Typical Street Scene - Glass Market:**

You're on Obsidian Way—the main artisan street. It's 30 feet wide, paved with smooth basalt. Ash drifts down constantly—street sweepers work all day with brooms made of wire (stiff enough to move ash, flexible enough not to scratch stone).

Both sides are lined with workshops—obsidian crafters primarily. The street is famous for volcanic glass work: weapons, tools, jewelry, art pieces. Ashgate obsidian is renowned across Tirvandor—sharper than steel, beautiful, and magically receptive.

Each workshop is open-fronted during work hours. Inside, you see the process: raw obsidian chunks being examined (clarity, color, flaws), master crafters striking stone with precision (one wrong blow shatters everything), apprentices polishing finished pieces (bringing out the glass-like shine).

The sound is distinctive—obsidian being struck makes a high, clear ring. Different tones mean different densities. Master crafters can hear flaws. The street creates a strange music—dozens of workshops, each striking at different rhythms.

Between workshops are essential services: a stone merchant (selling raw obsidian), a tool maker (crafting the specialized chisels for volcanic glass), a water seller (essential—you dehydrate fast here), an ash filter maker (protective masks).

The people move deliberately—heat makes you slow, conserve energy. No one runs unless emergency. Conversation is quiet—loud talking wastes water (you breathe more).

**Random Detail Table - Ashgate Streets:**
Roll d20:
1. Ash storm blowing in, everyone taking cover, shuttering windows
2. Obsidian crafter accidentally shatters valuable piece, cursing loudly
3. Water seller ringing bell, people buying to rehydrate
4. Fire genasi performing flame tricks for crowds, unbothered by heat
5. Steam vent suddenly venting, people jumping back, regular occurrence
6. Street sweeper clearing ash, endless battle against nature
7. Tourist fainting from heat, locals helping to shade, giving water
8. Lava flow visible in distance, glowing orange against black rock
9. Volcanic tremor, buildings shaking, people unconcerned (normal here)
10. Apprentice running errands, carrying wrapped obsidian carefully
11. Fire cult procession, members in red robes, chanting
12. Obsidian merchant examining stones for quality, rejecting flawed ones
13. Children playing game with obsidian shards, surprisingly safe
14. Street vendor selling ash-proof food, heavily covered
15. Armorer fitting obsidian blade to weapon hilt, precise work
16. Scholar studying volcanic patterns, taking notes
17. Guard checking newcomers for heat tolerance, warning unprepared
18. Healer treating heat exhaustion, common ailment
19. News about volcanic activity, people discussing calmly
20. Phoenix sighting (rare), everyone stopping to watch, good omen

### The Hot Springs District

**Located:** Northeast section, built around natural hot springs

**The Springs:**
A network of natural hot springs—water heated by underground lava flows, emerging at temperatures from pleasantly warm to scalding. The springs are terraced, channeled, and built around. This district is the social center of Ashgate.

**Architecture - Springs District:**
Buildings here are built for bathing culture. Open courtyards, pools visible from streets, steam vents used for heating. Wealthier establishments have private pools. Public baths serve everyone.

**Public Bathhouse Scene:**

The largest bathhouse—The Eternal Flame—serves hundreds daily. It's built in tiers:

**Entry Level:** You pay admission (reasonable—bathing is necessity here, not luxury). You're given a cloth, soap, locker key. The air is thick with steam.

**Cold Pool:** First stop—cold water (actually just cool by local standards). Washes off ash, sweat, daily grime. It's crowded, social, noisy.

**Warm Pool:** Larger, multiple temperatures depending on which spring feeds each section. This is where people linger—talking, relaxing, conducting business. Ashgate's social life happens in bathhouses.

**Hot Pool:** Smaller, truly hot, therapeutic. Helps with volcanic ash lung, muscle aches from heat, joint pain. Only used for short periods.

**Steam Rooms:** Natural steam from volcanic vents. Good for breathing, skin, general health. Popular with crafters whose lungs suffer from obsidian dust.

**Social Life:**
Bathhouses are where deals get made, alliances form, gossip spreads, politics happen. Everyone bathes daily (necessity in the ash and heat). You see everyone—rich and poor, powerful and weak—naked in the same water. It creates a unique social dynamic.

### The Ashwarden Fortress

**Located:** Built into volcanic caldera wall, overlooking the city

**Purpose:** Headquarters of the Ashwardens—the organization that monitors volcanic activity, predicts eruptions, manages lava flows, and protects the city from fire-based threats.

**The Fortress:**
Black obsidian walls, red-glowing enchantments, constantly warm to the touch. The Ashwardens work day and night—monitoring deep earth tremors, watching lava flow patterns, maintaining the city's fire wards.

Inside: A mix of military post, research facility, and fire temple. Walls covered with maps showing lava tubes, historical eruption patterns, current threat assessments. Central chamber has a massive obsidian scrying orb—shows real-time volcanic activity beneath the city.

**The Wardens:**
A mix of druids, rangers, fire genasi, and specialized mages. They wear black robes with red flames. The populace treats them with respect bordering on reverence—the Wardens keep the city safe from the volcano's wrath.

### The Glass Bazaar

**Located:** Central market district

**What's Special:**
This marketplace specializes in volcanic glass goods. Everything obsidian—weapons, tools, jewelry, art, magical focuses, even architectural elements.

**The Experience:**
Walking through is like being in a museum. Display cases show masterwork pieces—obsidian daggers with edges sharper than razors, jewelry that catches light like captured fire, sculptures of volcanic glass in impossible detail.

The prices range from affordable (simple tools) to astronomical (masterwork weapons with magical properties). Wealthy collectors come from across Tirvandor to shop here.

**What Ashgate Offers:**
- **Obsidian Goods:** Best volcanic glass work in the world
- **Hot Springs:** Therapeutic bathing, social center
- **Fire Magic:** Fire genasi community, fire-based spell research
- **Volcanic Tours:** Guided expeditions (dangerous but lucrative)
- **Heat Resistance Training:** Learning to survive in volcanic environments

**Why Players Visit:**
- Buying obsidian weapons (masterwork quality)
- Researching fire magic or volcanic phenomena
- Investigating fire cult activity
- Seeking Ashwarden aid against fire threats
- Following rumors of phoenix sightings

# Aethoria Cities - Detailed Walkthroughs

## Aethermere - The Starlight Capital

**Population:** ~42,000 (60% elf, 20% half-elf, 10% human, 10% other)

### Approaching from the South Road

**5 Miles Out:**
The forest changes. Trees become larger, older, more deliberate in arrangement. The canopy overhead creates a green cathedral. Sunlight filters through in shafts—almost theatrical. The air smells of flowers, clean water, and something indefinable—magic perhaps, or just the scent of an ancient forest undisturbed.

You notice the quiet first. Not silence—birds sing, leaves rustle, water flows—but an absence of harsh sounds. No axes chopping, no construction noise, no urban cacophony. The forest has its own rhythm.

**2 Miles Out:**
The path becomes more deliberate. It's not paved, but it's clearly maintained—roots won't trip you, branches won't strike your face, the way is clear without being obviously cleared. Natural but guided.

You see the first outer buildings—but "buildings" is the wrong word. Structures grown as much as built. Trees shaped while living, branches woven into walls, living wood bent and trained into architecture. The effect is organic, beautiful, and slightly unsettling if you're from Thaldros.

**1 Mile Out:**
Lake Aether comes into view through the trees. It's massive—you can't see the far shore. The water is impossibly clear, impossibly still, reflecting the sky perfectly. In daylight, it's mirror-bright. At night (they say), it reflects stars that aren't in the actual sky.

The city rises from the lakeshore—but it doesn't tower. Aethermere spreads horizontally, growing into the forest rather than above it. Buildings flow between trees. Streets curve naturally. Nothing is straight-lined or rigid.

**Entering:**
There are no gates. No walls. No checkpoints. The transition from forest to city is gradual. You're walking through woods, then you're walking past dwellings, then you're in the city proper. You didn't notice when exactly it changed.

This openness is deliberate—Aethermere doesn't fear invasion. The elves have confidence (arrogance?) that they could defend without walls if needed. Or maybe they don't expect attack. Or maybe the forest itself is defense.

### The Lakeshore District - Aether's Edge

**The Approach:**
You emerge from tree-shaded paths to sudden openness—the lakeshore. The transition is dramatic. From forest shadow to lake-reflected light. Your eyes need a moment to adjust.

**The Docks:**
Not docks like Goldreach—no heavy piers, no industrial loading. These are elegant wooden platforms extending into the water, seemingly floating. Boats are moored—graceful sailboats, narrow canoes, magical constructs that move without visible propulsion.

The docks serve transportation more than trade—Aethermere imports little. The boats ferry people across the lake, to offshore islands, to lakeside settlements.

**Architecture - Lakeshore:**
- **Materials:** Living wood (trees shaped while growing), white stone (imported, used for public buildings), glass (large windows, capturing lake light)
- **Design:** Curves, not straight lines. Buildings flow into surroundings
- **Roofs:** Living branches woven overhead, flowering vines (decorative and functional—shade, rain cover)
- **Windows:** Large, open, minimal barriers (climate is mild, threats are rare)
- **Decoration:** Natural—flowering plants, water features, crystal ornaments catching light

**Typical Scene - Lakeshore Promenade:**

You're walking along the Starwalk—a broad path following the lakeshore. It's 50 feet wide, paved with smooth white stone that seems to glow faintly in moonlight (enchanted, probably).

On your left—the lake. So clear you can see fish swimming, underwater plants waving. The surface reflects everything—clouds, buildings, passersby. Children play at the water's edge. Artists sit painting the view. Couples walk hand in hand.

On your right—the city. Buildings rise organically from the ground—grown as much as built. Ground floors are open to the air—shops, cafes, workshops without walls, just roofs and floor. Everything flows together.

People move without hurry. There's a graceful quality to movement here—elves naturally glide, and others adapt to the pace. No one shouts. Conversations are quiet. Laughter is musical.

The smell is flowers—always flowers. Jasmine, honeysuckle, roses, others you don't recognize. The scent isn't overwhelming—it's natural, present without dominating.

**Random Detail Table - Aethermere Streets:**
Roll d20:
1. Elf children releasing floating lanterns onto lake, hundreds drifting
2. Street musician playing crystal chimes, hauntingly beautiful melody
3. Scholar debating philosophy with students, sitting in circle under trees
4. Artist painting watercolor of lake, crowd watching respectfully
5. Swan gliding near shore, definitely more intelligent than normal swans
6. Couple having wedding ceremony at water's edge, small gathering
7. Elderly elf feeding fish, hundreds swarming near dock
8. Merchant from Thaldros looking uncomfortable, out of place
9. Magic lesson in progress, students practicing illusions
10. Poet reciting verses, small audience listening intently
11. Water sprite appearing briefly, playing with children, vanishing
12. Moon elf performing nighttime blessing even during day
13. Craftsman demonstrating woodshaping, bending branch without tools
14. Healer tending injured bird, channeling magic gently
15. Scout returning from patrol, reporting to elder calmly
16. Stargazer setting up equipment despite daylight, preparing for evening
17. Dancer practicing by water, movements reflected in surface
18. Archery practice, targets floating on lake, incredible precision
19. Group meditation, dozen elves in perfect stillness
20. Fey creature visiting from Feywild, casually shopping

### The University - The Starlit Towers

**Located:** Northern section, built on slight elevation overlooking lake

**The Campus:**
Not enclosed—buildings spread through ancient grove. Each building serves different school of study. Paths wind between them, crossing bridges over streams, passing meditation gardens.

**The Buildings:**
Each school of magic has its tower—though "tower" is misleading. These structures rise only 4-5 stories but feel taller due to proportions. They're grown from ancient trees, wood shaped into architecture, with crystal additions capturing and refracting light.

- **Evocation Tower:** Scarred from practice—scorch marks, frost damage, acid stains. Constantly repaired. Most popular among younger students.
- **Divination Observatory:** Top floor is all glass—crystal dome capturing starlight even during day. Telescopes, scrying focuses, star charts everywhere.
- **Illusion Hall:** Seems to move when not directly observed. Architecture shifts subtly. Popular with artists and entertainers.
- **Enchantment Spire:** Beautiful, welcoming, draws you in. Decorated with crystals that whisper suggestions. Teaching through demonstration.
- **Necromancy Grove:** Set apart, darker trees, quieter. Not forbidden—elves accept death as part of cycle—but respected, approached seriously.
- **Library of Infinite Pages:** Largest building—five stories, seemingly larger inside than outside. Contains knowledge collected over three millennia.

**The Library:**

Worth special mention. This is one of the great repositories of knowledge in Tirvandor.

**Entry Hall:** Enormous chamber, soaring ceiling, natural light filtering through crystal skylights. The smell is old paper, leather bindings, preserved knowledge.

**The Stacks:** Stretch in all directions. The organization system is complex—not alphabetical or by subject alone, but by conceptual connections. Elves understand it intuitively. Others need guides.

**Special Collections:** Restricted sections—ancient texts, dangerous knowledge, prophecies, forbidden magic. Access requires permission, often denied.

**Reading Rooms:** Scattered throughout—quiet spaces with comfortable chairs, natural light, small tables. Scholars spend days here, lost in research.

**The Keepers:** Librarians here are more than organizers—they're guardians of knowledge, helping researchers find connections between texts, guiding study, occasionally denying access to things they deem unready for discovery.

### The Artisan Quarter - Silverleaf District

**Located:** Eastern section, closer to Silverwood forest proper

**Specialization:** Crafting using living materials—woodshaping, crystal growing, natural dye work, metal singing (working metal with magic rather than force).

**Architecture - Artisan Quarter:**
Workshops are gardens as much as buildings. Craftsmen work outdoors when possible. Tools are minimal—hands, magic, patience matter more than implements.

**Typical Workshop - Master Woodshaper:**

You enter a grove that's also a workshop. Trees grow in specific patterns—deliberately shaped over decades. The master works at the center, hands on a young sapling, shaping it through magic and will.

Around the grove—finished pieces. Furniture that grew as single pieces (no joints, no weak points). Bows made from still-living wood (stronger, more flexible). Musical instruments with grain patterns that enhance sound.

The work is slow—shaping living wood takes time. Months or years for a single piece. But the results are unmatched—beautiful, strong, perfectly suited to purpose.

**The Crystal Garden:**

Special location—where crystal artisans grow magical crystals for wands, focuses, jewelry.

The garden is a cave—natural formation—with quartz veins in the walls. Artisans introduce seeds (tiny crystal fragments) and use magic to encourage growth. The crystals grow slowly, forming specific shapes based on magical guidance.

The result—crystals with unique properties. Some enhance divination. Some store magic efficiently. Some sing when sunlight touches them. Each is unique.

### The Council Grove

**Located:** Geographic center of city

**Purpose:** Where the Council of Elders meets, makes decisions, resolves disputes, announces changes.

**The Grove:**
Ancient oaks—some over 2000 years old—arranged in circle around clear space. The oldest, largest oak stands at north—the Wisdom Tree, said to house the spirit of Aethermere's founder.

When Council meets, they sit on roots of the circle trees—no chairs, no formal furniture. The symbolism—they're rooted in the land, part of the forest, grounded in tradition.

**Council Meetings:**
Open to all—anyone can attend, witness, petition. But speaking requires recognition—you must be called upon. The process is formal without being rigid.

Decisions are made by consensus, not vote. Discussion continues until agreement emerges. This can take hours. Days. Weeks for important matters. The elves have patience.

**What Aethermere Offers:**
- **Education:** Finest magical education in Tirvandor
- **Healing:** Elven healers using natural magic
- **Crafting:** Masterwork items using living materials
- **Knowledge:** Library access (if you can navigate the system)
- **Meditation:** Quiet spaces for contemplation
- **Stargazing:** Clearest views of night sky

**Why Players Visit:**
- Researching magical topics
- Learning specific spells or traditions
- Commissioning elven-crafted items
- Seeking elven aid for nature-based problems
- Following prophecies or divinations
- Investigating Feywild connections

## Starfall - The Sacred City

**Population:** ~25,000 (55% elf, 25% half-elf, 15% human, 5% other)

### Approaching from Any Direction

**10 Miles Out:**
The terrain rises. You're climbing into foothills, then actual mountains. The forest here is different from Silverwood—more rugged, windswept, ancient.

At night (and Starfall is best approached at night), you see the lights. Not city lights—starlight. Focused, concentrated, brighter than it should be. The city glows with captured starlight.

**5 Miles Out:**
The mountains form a bowl—natural amphitheater facing the sky. Starfall sits at the bottom of this bowl, protected from wind, open to heaven. The positioning is perfect for astronomical observation—minimal light pollution, clear air, unobstructed view.

**2 Miles Out:**
The road becomes steeper. You're breathing hard. The air is thin—high altitude. But it's incredibly clear. On cloudless nights, you can see thousands of stars, the Milky Way like a river of light across the sky.

Starfall appears below—a city built in concentric circles, each ring lower than the last, descending into the valley floor. From above, it looks like a spiral galaxy reflected on earth.

**Entering:**
No walls—none needed at this altitude, this remote. The outer ring is residential—simple dwellings for support staff, families of scholars, visiting researchers.

The inner rings—progressively more important. Each ring requires greater access. The innermost ring—the Obserwatory Circle—is restricted to astronomers, divination specialists, those who read the stars.

### The Observatory Circle

**Located:** Valley floor, lowest and most protected point

**Architecture:**
Domes. Dozens of them. Crystal and metal, designed to open to the sky, to track celestial movements, to capture starlight for study.

The largest—the Grand Observatory—rises 100 feet high. Its dome is pure crystal, enchanted to be transparent when needed, opaque for protection, and magnifying for enhanced viewing.

**Inside the Grand Observatory:**

**Entry Level:** Maps. Walls covered with star charts—historical observations going back 2000 years. Tracking planetary movements, comet appearances, celestial events.

**Second Level:** Calculation rooms. Mathematicians working on orbital mechanics, predicting eclipses, calculating positions. The work is complex—blackboards covered with equations, arguments about degree measurements.

**Third Level:** Libraries. Books on astronomy, divination, celestial magic, prophecy. Restricted—not forbidden, but requires explanation of research purpose.

**Fourth Level:** The Observation Deck. The dome opens above. Massive telescope—crystal lenses enchanted to gather light, resolve detail impossible for normal eyes. Astronomers work in rotation—different specialties need different conditions.

**The Telescope:**
Not just for observation—it's a divination tool. By observing star patterns, alignments, celestial movements, trained diviners can predict events, interpret omens, understand cosmic patterns affecting the material plane.

The telescope is so sensitive that it can see things that shouldn't be visible—distortions in space, brief glimpses of other planes, anomalies that hint at cosmic events beyond mortal understanding.

### The Stargazer's District

**Located:** Second ring from center

**Population:** Scholars, diviners, astronomers, mathematicians, philosophers

**The Buildings:**
Designed around astronomy. Flat roofs for personal telescopes. Windows facing optimal directions. Dark interiors (light ruins night vision).

**Typical Scene - Evening:**

Dusk is sacred time in Starfall. As sun sets, the city comes alive.

Rooftops fill with people—setting up telescopes, checking star charts, discussing what to observe tonight. The excitement is palpable. Every clear night is opportunity—to see something new, confirm a theory, witness a predicted event.

As darkness deepens, the city goes quiet. Sound disturbs observation. Lights are dimmed, shielded. Everyone respects the work happening above.

Through the night, you hear occasional excitement—a discovery, a successful observation, a rare event. But mostly—quiet focus. Hundreds of eyes watching the sky.

Before dawn—activity increases. Last observations before sunrise. Checking one more thing. Recording final notes. Then—sleep. Astronomers work nocturnal schedules.

**The Starlight Library:**

Special collection—prophecies, divination records, cosmic event predictions.

The library is dark—deliberately. Eyes need to adjust from bright reading light to dark sky. The books are written in luminous ink—visible in dim light, won't ruin night vision.

The prophecies here are organized by time period, by diviner, by certainty level (some are clear, others ambiguous, some proven wrong). Researchers study patterns—how prophecies manifest, what signs precede major events.

### The Celestial Temple

**Located:** Third ring

**Dedicated:** To Celestia, goddess of stars and fate

**The Temple:**
Open to sky—no roof, just pillars supporting arched pathways around central courtyard. The floor is polished black stone, reflecting stars perfectly when clean.

The temple serves as both worship site and divination tool. Priests read patterns in how starlight falls, how reflections align, how shadows form during celestial events.

**Worship Services:**
Held at specific astronomical events—new moons, full moons, planetary alignments, meteor showers, eclipses. The timing is precise—services begin when celestial events occur, not at convenient times.

The worship is quiet—meditation, observation, contemplation. Celestia's followers believe meaning emerges from watching, understanding patterns, accepting fate while working to comprehend it.

### The Prophecy Archive

**Located:** Fourth ring, heavily restricted

**Purpose:** Recording and studying prophecies, visions, divinations

**Security:** Not guarded—elves don't lock things typically—but access requires Council permission. The prophecies here are powerful, potentially dangerous, often misunderstood.

**Contents:**
- Major prophecies affecting Tirvandor's future
- Historical prophecies (to study how they manifested)
- Failed prophecies (important—understanding when divination was wrong helps interpret current visions)
- Sealed prophecies (deemed too dangerous or unclear to release)

**The Work:**
Scholars here study prophecy as science and art. They cross-reference visions from multiple sources, look for patterns, attempt to translate symbolic language into actionable understanding.

The challenge—prophecy is rarely literal. Symbols, metaphors, alternate interpretations all matter. A prophecy saying "the mountain falls" might mean: an actual mountain, political power represented by mountain, personal strength, metaphorical stability—who knows?

**What Starfall Offers:**
- **Prophecy:** Divination services (expensive, not always clear)
- **Star Reading:** Personal fate interpretation
- **Astronomical Knowledge:** Best star charts, planetary tables
- **Training:** Learning divination, scrying, far-seeing
- **Sanctuary:** Quiet retreat for contemplation

**Why Players Visit:**
- Seeking specific prophecy or divination
- Researching celestial events
- Learning about fate, destiny, predetermined events
- Following prophecy clues
- Witnessing rare astronomical event

## Crystalbrook - The Jewel of the Lakes

**Population:** ~30,000 (50% elf, 20% human, 15% halfling, 10% gnome, 5% other)

### Approaching from the West

**3 Miles Out:**
The landscape is lakes. Dozens of them—connected by streams, separated by narrow land bridges, creating a maze of water and shore. The water is crystalline—you can see to the bottom even in deep sections. The clarity is supernatural.

The roads here are raised causeways—built up above water level, allowing passage between lakes. During spring floods, some causeways disappear underwater—you need boats.

**1 Mile Out:**
Crystalbrook appears—but it's not what you expect. The city isn't built on one shore—it's spread across a dozen islands, connected by bridges, each island a distinct district.

The water between islands is busy—boats everywhere. Canoes, sailboats, barges, rafts. This is a water city. Many residents never touch dry land.

The architecture is designed for reflections—white stone, crystal windows, mirrored surfaces. The entire city reflects in the water, creating a doubled effect. From a distance, you can't tell which is city and which is reflection.

**Entering:**
There's no main gate—too many entry points. You arrive at one of the outer islands and proceed inward. Bridges connect everything. Some bridges are arched stone. Some are flat wooden platforms. Some are magical constructs—force bridges that appear when needed.

The first thing you notice—the sound. Water everywhere. Lapping against shores, flowing through channels, dripping from fountains, splashing from boats. The city has a constant water soundtrack.

The smell is clean—fresh water, aquatic plants, occasionally fish, but mostly just pure water scent.

### The Central Island - Crystal Heart

**Located:** Geographic center, largest island

**Purpose:** Government, commerce, major landmarks

**Architecture - Central Island:**
Buildings here are white marble and crystal. The marble is quarried from underwater deposits (special magic-resistant stone). The crystal comes from the lakes themselves—natural formations that grow in the clear water, harvested and shaped.

**The Grand Plaza:**

A massive circular plaza—500 feet across—paved with white marble that's been polished mirror-smooth. When wet (which is often), it reflects the sky perfectly. During rain, the plaza becomes a shallow mirror—people seem to walk on clouds.

Around the plaza—major buildings:

- **The Lake Palace:** Where the Council of Waters meets. Four stories, crystal walls, water flowing through interior channels. You can see fish swimming through the building.
- **The Crystal Exchange:** Trading house for gems, crystals, magical focuses. Heavily guarded. Crystals from Crystalbrook are valued across Tirvandor.
- **The Tidecaller's Guild:** Water magic specialists, engineers who manage the city's water systems, hydrologists.
- **The Harbor Master's Hall:** Coordinates boat traffic (essential—hundreds of boats daily).

**Typical Scene - Crystal Heart Plaza:**

Midday. The plaza is busy—market day. Merchants have set up stalls under canvas awnings (sun reflecting off water and white stone is intense).

The goods are water-focused: boats, fishing gear, water-resistant clothing, aquatic plants (medicinal and culinary), crystals and gems, mirrors, glass work, ice (harvested from northern lakes, transported in magical cold boxes).

Boats arrive constantly at the island's edges—merchants unloading goods, customers departing after purchases, water taxis carrying passengers between islands.

The people move differently here—they're conscious of water nearby. No running (easy to fall in). Careful footing on wet stone. Casual grace from lifelong practice.

Children play at water's edge—supervised. Falling in isn't dangerous (everyone swims), but parents watch anyway. Lifeguards are stationed at intervals—more for rescue from currents than drowning.

**Random Detail Table - Crystalbrook Streets:**
Roll d20:
1. Water taxi race between competitive boatmen, passengers holding on
2. Crystal merchant displaying gems in sunlight, spectacular rainbows
3. Child falling off dock, rescued immediately, parent scolding
4. Street vendor selling grilled fish, caught that morning
5. Water weird performing in fountain, gathering crowd
6. Boat collision, both drivers arguing about right-of-way
7. Storm approaching, everyone checking boat moorings, securing goods
8. Ice sculptor creating piece on hot day, racing melting
9. Diving competition at deep dock, excellent swimmers showing off
10. Aquatic elf visiting from underwater city, rare sight
11. Mirror seller demonstrating magical mirrors, showing distant places
12. Flood warning announced, people moving to higher islands
13. Romantic couple in boat, being serenaded by water genasi musician
14. Glass bottom boat offering tours, showcasing underwater ruins
15. Pearl diver emerging with find, crowd gathering to see
16. Water elemental moving through canal, people clearing path respectfully
17. Bridge temporarily failed, magic needs recharging, crowd waiting
18. Underwater window shop—viewing aquatic life below street level
19. Rain started, everyone continuing normally, unbothered
20. Crystal resonance event—all crystals humming same tone, magical

### The Bridges

**Essential Infrastructure:**
Crystalbrook has over 200 bridges. Some are famous, named, historic. Others are functional, numbered, maintained.

**Bridge Types:**

**Stone Arch Bridges:** Oldest, most solid. Built during city founding. White marble, carved decorations, built to last millennia. Wide enough for carts. These connect major islands.

**Floating Pontoon Bridges:** Temporary, movable. Used where permanent bridges aren't practical. Made from treated wood, enchanted for buoyancy. Can be disconnected and moved during floods.

**Crystal Bridges:** Magical constructs. Transparent, seemingly fragile, actually incredibly strong. Expensive to maintain. Used for prestigious locations.

**Force Bridges:** Pure magic. Appear when activated (command word or gesture), disappear when not needed. Used for private access, emergencies, or special events.

**Rope Bridges:** Narrow, swaying, unnerving. Connect smaller islands or provide shortcuts. Locals use them confidently. Visitors go slowly.

### The Waterways

**Not Just Background:**
The canals, channels, and lake passages are streets. Boat traffic is regulated like wagon traffic in other cities.

**Traffic Rules:**
- Larger boats have right-of-way
- Clockwise travel around islands
- No anchoring in main channels
- Speed limits in residential areas
- Horn signals for intentions (turning, stopping, passing)

**Boat Types:**

**Water Taxis:** For hire. Flat-bottomed boats, room for 4-6 passengers. Driver stands at rear, uses single oar for propulsion. Fast, efficient, cheap.

**Cargo Barges:** Flat, wide, slow. Transport goods between islands. Pulled by swimming horses or propelled by poles.

**Personal Canoes:** Everyone owns one. Used like you'd use a horse elsewhere. Stored at docks by homes, businesses.

**Sailboats:** For longer trips across larger lakes. Elegant, fast when wind cooperates, slower than paddle boats in calm.

**Magical Craft:** Expensive. Self-propelled, no visible means of movement. Status symbols. Used by wealthy, government officials.

### The Underwater City

**Exists:** Below the surface, constructed by aquatic elves, accessible to those with water-breathing.

**What's There:**
- Markets for underwater resources (special corals, deep-lake plants, pearls)
- Residences for aquatic races
- Research stations studying deep lake ecology
- Magical laboratories (underwater environment useful for certain magic)
- Ancient ruins (city built on top of older civilization, partially submerged)

**Access:**
For surface dwellers—rental water-breathing magic (potions, temporary enchantments, paid breathing spells). Expensive but available.

**Why Go:**
Curiosity, unique shopping, underwater ruins exploration, research, trade with aquatic races.

### The Crystal Gardens

**Located:** Southern island cluster

**Purpose:** Growing magical crystals for commercial harvest

**The Gardens:**
Not gardens in normal sense. Underwater plots where crystals grow naturally, tended by crystal farmers who encourage specific growth patterns.

**The Process:**
1. Seed crystal planted in lake bed (specific depth, water composition matters)
2. Natural magic in water encourages growth
3. Crystal farmers monitor, adjust water conditions, use magic to guide formation
4. Growth takes years (small crystals) to decades (large formations)
5. Harvest carefully (breaking wrong way ruins crystal)
6. Polish, cut, enchant, sell

**The Quality:**
Crystalbrook crystals are famous. The water purity, magical saturation, and skillful cultivation produce crystals ideal for spell focusing, magical item construction, divination tools.

**What Crystalbrook Offers:**
- **Crystals and Gems:** Finest magical crystals in Tirvandor
- **Water Magic:** Schools teaching water-based spells
- **Boat Building:** Master craftsmen creating specialized watercraft
- **Mirror Magic:** Scrying, communication, illusion work using mirrors
- **Underwater Exploration:** Guided tours of submerged ruins
- **Fishing:** Some of best fishing in Tirvandor

**Why Players Visit:**
- Buying/commissioning magical crystals or focuses
- Researching water magic or aquatic phenomena
- Exploring underwater ruins
- Investigating crystal theft or smuggling
- Seeking aquatic allies or information
- Learning underwater combat or survival

## Wildgrove - The Jungle Heart

**Population:** ~20,000 (40% elf, 30% human, 20% halfling, 10% other)

### Approaching Through the Jungle

**10 Miles Out:**
The jungle is different here—wilder, older, more alive. The trees are enormous—some 300 feet tall, trunks 40 feet in diameter, roots that form walls. The canopy is so thick that ground level is in perpetual twilight.

The jungle is loud—birds calling, monkeys screaming, insects buzzing, unseen animals moving through undergrowth. It's overwhelming at first.

The heat is oppressive. 90+ degrees, 90% humidity. You sweat constantly. Clothing sticks to skin. Breathing feels thick.

**5 Miles Out:**
The path becomes more deliberate—not cleared, but guided. Vines trimmed just enough for passage. Roots carved with steps. Markers showing the way (natural-looking but definitely placed).

You start seeing signs of habitation—carved symbols on trees (territory markers, warnings, directions), rope bridges overhead (connecting canopy levels), occasional treehouses in lower branches.

**2 Miles Out:**
The forest becomes cultivated without looking cultivated. The fruit trees are too regularly spaced to be natural. The useful plants are too common. The dangerous plants have been removed. But it all looks wild—deliberate invisibility.

Wildgrove itself isn't visible until you're almost there. The city is IN the forest—built into trees, under canopy, using living wood. It doesn't impose on jungle—it becomes part of jungle.

**Entering:**
No gates, no walls, no obvious boundary. You're in jungle, then you're passing dwellings, then you're in the city proper. The transition is gradual.

The city exists on multiple levels:
- **Ground Level:** Warehouses, workshops, water collection, gardens
- **Lower Canopy (20-50 feet):** Residential, markets, common spaces
- **Mid Canopy (50-100 feet):** Wealthier residences, government, special buildings
- **Upper Canopy (100+ feet):** Observatories, lookouts, sacred spaces

Moving between levels requires climbing—rope ladders, carved steps in trees, pulley platforms, trained animals (giant lizards with passenger saddles).

### The Ground Level - The Roots

**The Experience:**
Dim light filtered through leaves. Humidity intense. Temperature slightly cooler than above canopy. The smell is rich—earth, rot, flowers, spices, animals.

The ground is covered with root systems—massive roots from trees above, creating a maze. Buildings are built between roots, using them as walls, supports.

**Architecture - Ground Level:**
- **Materials:** Living wood (shaped roots), woven vines, treated leaves (waterproofing), bamboo-like plants
- **Purpose:** Storage, workshops requiring space, water collection cisterns
- **Design:** Natural—buildings blend into root structures
- **Windows:** Few—light is limited at ground level anyway

**Typical Scene - Root District:**

You're walking through a passage between two massive roots—they form natural walls 15 feet high. The path is packed earth, well-traveled, maintained.

Both sides have workshops built into root hollows—a carpenter using living wood (shaping, not cutting), a weaver working jungle fibers, a potter using clay from nearby riverbank, a leather worker processing hide.

The workshops are open-fronted—no doors, just awnings for rain protection. Everyone can see everyone working—communal, transparent.

Between workshops—cisterns collecting rainwater (essential—can't drink river water directly), food storage (elevated to prevent rot and pests), animal pens (small jungle pigs, birds, lizards for eggs/meat).

The noise is work sounds mixed with jungle sounds—hammering, sawing, weaving, plus bird calls, monkey chatter, insect buzz. Everything blends.

### The Lower Canopy - The Living Level

**Located:** 20-50 feet up

**Access:** Rope ladders (permanent, well-maintained), carved steps in tree trunks, pulley platforms (operated by hand or trained animals)

**The Experience:**
More light—not bright, but visible. Air movement (slight breeze). Temperature same but feels better with air flow.

This is where most residents live. Platforms built between trees, using branches as supports, creating a second ground level 30 feet up.

**Architecture - Lower Canopy:**
- **Platforms:** Woven from strong vines, treated for waterproofing, supported by living branches
- **Buildings:** Light construction—bamboo frames, leaf roofs, vine walls (privacy without weight)
- **Bridges:** Connect everything—platforms linked by rope bridges, wooden walkways, vine swings for the brave
- **Gardens:** Everywhere—planters, climbing plants, hanging gardens, using every surface

**Typical Scene - Residential Platform:**

You're standing on a platform 30 feet up—it's surprisingly solid, doesn't sway much. The platform is 200 feet long, 50 feet wide, with about 20 family dwellings.

Each dwelling is a simple structure—bamboo frame, leaf-thatch roof, woven vine walls. Inside (you can see through gaps)—hammocks for sleeping (beds retain too much heat), storage baskets hanging from ceiling, cooking area (small fire in clay pot, vented carefully), water barrel (filled daily from ground-level cisterns).

Between dwellings—communal spaces. Cooking areas (larger fires, shared use). Children's play areas (supervised constantly—falling is real danger). Meeting spaces (benches woven from vines, shaded areas for conversations).

The bridges connecting platforms are in constant use—people visiting neighbors, children running (despite parental warnings), workers heading to/from jobs, vendors carrying goods.

The air smells of cooking—spices, roasted meat, jungle fruits, something always cooking in communal areas.

**Random Detail Table - Wildgrove Platforms:**
Roll d20:
1. Child chasing monkey that stole food, both scrambling across bridges
2. Healer treating someone for jungle fever, using local herbs
3. Merchant unpacking exotic goods, crowd gathering to see
4. Platform sagging, workers reinforcing supports, concerned residents
5. Cooking competition, multiple fires going, judges tasting
6. Rope bridge frayed, being replaced, people taking longer route
7. Tropical storm approaching, everyone securing loose items
8. Snake in dwelling, expert calmly removing it, common occurrence
9. Birth celebration, entire platform gathered, singing, dancing
10. Tree surgeon treating sick support tree, serious concern
11. Water carrier delivering to upper platforms, using pulley system
12. Hunting party returning, displaying successful catch
13. Argument over platform space, elder mediating
14. Flying creature (bird? reptile?) swooping close, everyone ducking
15. Musician performing, using jungle instruments—hollow logs, shells, dried seeds
16. Child's first climb to lower canopy, family watching proudly
17. Visitor from Thaldros struggling with heat, locals helping
18. Emergency—fire on platform, everyone responding with water
19. Weaver repairing bridge, working while suspended
20. Night market setting up as sun sets, torches being lit

### The Mid Canopy - The Power Level

**Located:** 50-100 feet up

**Access:** Fewer connections—more controlled access, better-maintained paths

**Purpose:** Government, wealth, specialization

Buildings here are more substantial—still using living wood, but shaped over decades, grown into specific forms. More permanent, more impressive.

**The Great Tree:**

The city center—literally. An ancient tree, 400 years old, 250 feet tall, 50-foot diameter trunk. The trunk has been shaped into a hollow central column with spiral staircase carved inside.

Different levels serve different purposes:

**Base Level (ground):** Open courtyard, public gathering space
**Level 1 (30 feet):** Public services—permit office, census takers, public records
**Level 2 (50 feet):** Council chambers—where city governance happens
**Level 3 (70 feet):** Meeting rooms for factions, guild halls, negotiation spaces
**Level 4 (90 feet):** Archives—city history, important documents, protected
**Level 5 (110 feet):** Elder's quarters—private, rarely opened to public

**The Council Chambers:**

Worth describing. You climb the internal staircase (walls are living wood, slightly bioluminescent—provides light). At level 2, you emerge into a circular chamber 60 feet in diameter.

The walls are the tree itself—living wood curved into smooth surface. Windows (actually carefully shaped gaps) provide light and air. The floor is a single massive wooden disc—grown as part of tree, polished smooth over centuries.

Seating is simple—benches grown from the floor itself, arranged in circles. The council sits in the center circle. Advisors and observers sit in outer rings. Everyone can see everyone—transparency is cultural value.

The ceiling is 20 feet high—cathedral-like. Vines hang decoratively. Small birds nest in corners (considered good luck). The acoustics are perfect—everyone can be heard.

### The Upper Canopy - The Sacred Level

**Located:** 100+ feet up

**Access:** Restricted—requires permission, escort, or specific purpose

**The Experience:**
Above most foliage—more sunlight, cooler temperature (slight breeze at this height), incredible views (can see miles across jungle canopy).

This level is for observation, communication, spiritual practice.

**The Observatory Platforms:**

Multiple platforms at treetops—used for:
- **Weather Watching:** Predicting storms (critical in jungle)
- **Fire Spotting:** Jungle fires are catastrophic—early detection saves lives
- **Animal Migration:** Tracking flying creature patterns
- **Stars:** Astronomy (different tradition from Starfall's methods)
- **Communication:** Signal fires, mirror flashing, magical sending

**The Sacred Grove:**

Special location—cluster of ancient trees, platforms connecting them, used for spiritual practices.

The jungle elves follow nature-based traditions—honoring forest spirits, seasons, cycles of growth and decay. The upper canopy—closer to sky, further from earth—is considered threshold between worlds.

Rituals here involve:
- Sunrise/sunset observations
- Moon ceremonies (when visible through canopy)
- Plant growth blessings
- Animal migration blessings
- Weather prayers (for rain when needed, sun when needed)

Access is open for ceremonies, restricted otherwise—sacred spaces are respected.

### Jungle Markets

**Located:** Multiple locations, lower and mid canopy

**Specialization:** Jungle products

**What's For Sale:**
- **Food:** Tropical fruits, vegetables unknown outside jungle, spiced meats, insect protein (dried beetles, roasted grubs—actually quite good)
- **Medicine:** Jungle herbs (most effective healing plants grow here), poisons (if you know who to ask), antidotes (essential—jungle is dangerous)
- **Materials:** Exotic woods, jungle plant fibers, animal hides (ethically sourced—overhunting is taboo), feathers, bones
- **Live Animals:** Birds, monkeys, lizards, insects (some as pets, some as livestock, some as familiars)
- **Crafts:** Woven items, carved wood, jungle jewelry (seeds, shells, small bones)

**The Experience:**
Markets are loud, colorful, overwhelming. Vendors call out in multiple languages. Goods are displayed creatively—hanging from vines, arranged on leaves, in woven baskets. Bargaining is expected—but fair. Cheating is remembered, reputation matters.

### What Wildgrove Offers:
- **Jungle Products:** Materials and goods unavailable elsewhere
- **Guides:** Experts for jungle travel (essential—jungle kills unprepared)
- **Healing:** Jungle medicine (different from temple healing, equally effective)
- **Animal Training:** Experts in training jungle creatures
- **Survival Training:** Learning jungle survival skills
- **Druid Traditions:** Nature magic, animal communication, plant growth

**Why Players Visit:**
- Seeking rare jungle materials
- Hiring guides for expedition
- Researching jungle creatures or plants
- Treating exotic diseases
- Following leads about jungle ruins
- Learning survival skills

# Notable Towns - Detailed Scenes

## Deepforge - The Volcanic Smithies

**Population:** ~3,500 (80% dwarf, 20% other)
**Location:** Deep mountains, volcanic vents provide heat

### The Settlement:

Built in a caldera—extinct volcano crater, now stable. The lava has cooled but volcanic heat remains, channeled for forges.

**The Forges:**
Not coal-fired—these smithies use volcanic heat directly. Channels carved in rock direct heat from deep vents to forge chambers. Temperature control is precise—different vents, different temperatures.

**Why It Matters:**
Volcanic heat allows for special metalwork—higher temperatures, more precise control, unique alloys impossible elsewhere. Deepforge produces masterwork weapons, armor, specialty items.

**The Experience:**
Incredibly hot—even dwarves struggle. The air shimmers. Metal glows. The sound is constant—hammering, roaring heat, quenching steam.

**What Players Find:**
- Custom weapon/armor crafting (expensive, worth it)
- Rare metals (volcanic minerals with special properties)
- Master smiths (learning opportunities)
- Volcanic research (understanding fire magic, earth magic intersection)

### Random Encounter - Deepforge:
Roll d6:
1. Lava tube breached—emergency evacuation, forge cooling
2. Master smith accepts commission for legendary weapon
3. Earth tremor—minor, locals unconcerned, visitors nervous
4. New ore vein discovered—excited speculation about properties
5. Quenching accident—smith burned, healing needed
6. Competition between smiths—forging same item, judging quality

---

## Westmarch - The Frontier Outpost

**Population:** ~1,600 (70% human, 20% half-elf, 10% other)
**Location:** Western wilderness, last settlement before untamed lands

### The Outpost:

Small but fortified. Palisade walls (wooden—stone is too expensive here). Watch towers. Gates that actually close at night (unlike peaceful settlements).

**Architecture:**
Functional. No decoration. Buildings designed for defense—small windows, heavy doors, clear lines of sight, interior access between structures (don't need to go outside during attacks).

**The People:**
Rangers, scouts, hunters, trappers, adventurers using this as base. Everyone is armed. Everyone knows how to fight. This isn't because they're violent—it's because they need to be ready.

**What Threatens Them:**
- Bandits (using western wilderness as hideout)
- Monsters (unclaimed wilderness has things that eat people)
- Raiders (from even further west, beyond known settlements)
- Nature (harsh winters, dangerous animals, difficult terrain)

**What Players Find:**
- Ranger training opportunities
- Wilderness survival experts
- Information about western threats
- Work (always need guards, scouts, hunters)
- Staging point for western expeditions

### Typical Scene - Westmarch:

Evening. Gates closing. Everyone inside. The walls are manned—four guards per wall section, rotating shifts.

The common hall is full—entire settlement gathers here evenings. It's warm (central fire), loud (everyone talking), smells of cooking (communal meal—rationing supplies).

Conversations are practical: weather, game movements, tracks found, strange occurrences, who's going where tomorrow. These people live on information—knowing things keeps you alive.

New arrivals (like players) are noted immediately. Westmarch's leader—a grizzled ranger named Kael Stormwatcher—will approach. Not hostile, but direct: "What's your business here? How long staying? What skills?" Not rude—just practical. He needs to know who's in his outpost.

---

## Moonwell - The Lunar Sanctuary

**Population:** ~2,800 (60% elf, 25% human, 15% other)
**Location:** Built around lunar well that glows with moonlight

### The Well:

Natural formation—spring that emerges from rock, but the water glows with silver light. Not metaphor—actual visible glow, bright enough to read by. The light intensifies during full moon, dims during new moon, but never goes completely dark.

**The Water:**
Sacred. Not drunk casually—used for rituals, healing, moon magic, divination. The druids here protect the well, manage access, prevent desecration.

**Architecture:**
Built in circles around the well. Inner circle—temple. Middle circle—druid dwellings. Outer circle—residents and visitors. Everything oriented toward the well—symbolic and practical (the light provides illumination at night).

**The Moon Druids:**
Specialized circle—work with lunar magic, cycles, tides (even far from ocean), growth patterns tied to moon phases. They're scholars and practitioners—studying moon's influence, using it for beneficial magic.

**What Players Find:**
- Lunar magic training
- Prophecy services (moon reveals hidden truths)
- Healing (moon water has properties)
- Astronomical knowledge (moon phases, celestial events)
- Peaceful sanctuary (violence near the well is forbidden—strictly enforced)

### Night Scene - Moonwell:

Full moon. The well is brightest—casting enough light to create shadows. The entire settlement glows silver.

The druids are performing ceremony—standing in circle around well, chanting in Sylvan, gestures synchronized. The water responds—glowing brighter, patterns forming on surface, images appearing (visions, prophecies, messages from moon goddess).

Visitors watch from respectful distance. Some are pilgrims—faithful seeking blessings. Some are scholars—studying lunar phenomena. Some are seekers—looking for answers only moon can provide.

The ceremony takes hours—druids are patient, methodical. No rushing sacred work. The air is charged—not dangerous, but potent. Magic feels close, accessible, present.

---

## Vineheart - The Jungle Traders

**Population:** ~2,700 (50% human, 30% halfling, 20% other)
**Location:** Jungle clearing, major trade stop for jungle resources

### The Settlement:

Built in a rare large clearing—unusual in jungle, probably artificial (cleared centuries ago, maintained since). The clearing is 500 feet across—enough space for buildings, markets, open areas.

The jungle presses close—you're always aware it's there, waiting. Vines grow fast—constant maintenance needed to keep them from reclaiming the clearing.

**Architecture:**
Elevated buildings—stilts raise floors 6 feet up (flood protection, pest protection, ventilation). Steep roofs (rain runoff). Open walls (air circulation—enclosed buildings are ovens).

**The Market:**
The reason Vineheart exists. This is where jungle resources get traded to merchants heading back to civilization.

**What's Traded:**
FROM JUNGLE (going out):
- Exotic woods, fruits, spices, medicines, animal products, crafts

TO JUNGLE (coming in):
- Metal tools, preserved foods, cloth, rope, glass, manufactured goods

**The Traders:**
Professionals. They know jungle products—what's valuable, what's common, what's fake, what's illegal. They assess quality rapidly, offer fair prices (reputation matters—word spreads in jungle), arrange transport.

**What Players Find:**
- Jungle guides for hire
- Information about deeper jungle
- Unusual purchases (things not available in cities)
- Work (guards for trading caravans)
- Contacts with jungle dwellers

### Market Scene - Vineheart:

Morning. The market is setting up—merchants arranging goods, jungle harvesters bringing products from deep forest, traders examining inventory.

A jungle elf arrives with basket of rare orchids (valuable for perfume, medicine, alchemy). Three merchants bid—calling prices, showing currency. The elf is patient—knows value, won't be rushed. Eventually—agreement reached, orchids sold, elf departs with goods (not currency—barter preferred).

A young human couple—clearly new to jungle—try to buy machetes. The merchant asks questions: "Where heading? How long? What experience?" Not nosiness—responsibility. He won't sell inadequate equipment to people about to die. He recommends they hire guide, get training, start with shorter trips. They're offended at first, then realize he's right. They leave to find guide (merchant will point them to reputable ones).

An argument breaks out—trader claims wood quality isn't as promised. The seller is indignant—brings witnesses, shows documentation. The market elder arrives—examines wood, questions both parties, makes judgment. The wood IS as promised. The trader pays (and loses reputation for false claim).

## Using Street-Level Details: DM Advice

### Example Scene Flow:

**Setup:**
"You enter Kaer Thandros through the outer gates. The massive iron-bound doors tower 40 feet above you. The courtyard beyond is paved with perfectly fitted stones, worn smooth by centuries of boots. The air hits you immediately—coal smoke, worked iron, and the constant sound of hammering from dozens of forges."

**Player Response:**
"I want to find a smith to repair my sword."

**DM Response:**
"You're in the Outer City. Armorer's Row is the main street—you see forge glow spilling from every third or fourth doorway, hear the hammering echo constantly. The heat radiates 10 feet into the street. Master smiths' signs hang above doors—carved hammers, anvils, specific weapons. Which type of smith do you approach?"

**Improvisation:**
Player: "I look for someone who does blade work specifically."

DM: [Rolls on random detail table—gets result 16: "Dwarf forgemaster examining apprentice's work, shaking head disapprovingly"]

DM: "You spot a dwarf master smith outside a forge marked with a longsword sign. He's examining a blade his apprentice just finished, turning it in the light, shaking his head. 'The tang's too thin,' he's saying. 'Reforge it.' He notices you, looks at your sword, nods once. 'Blade needs work. I can see that from here. Come inside.'"

### The Goal:

Not to memorize everything. Not to describe everything. Just to give enough detail that players can see, hear, and feel the location. The street-level details are your toolkit—use what you need when you need it.
