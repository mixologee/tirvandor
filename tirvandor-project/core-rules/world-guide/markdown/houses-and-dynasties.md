# Pre-Sundering Conflicts

## The Ancient Grudges That Survived Continental Separation

When the Sundering tore the world apart 1,247 years ago (Year 0 CR), it didn't just split land—it split families, broke alliances, scattered artifacts, and created conflicts that echo to this day. Several noble houses have roots reaching back before the cataclysm, and their ancient grievances have festered across the Sundering Sea for over a millennium.

These conflicts are particularly dangerous because:
- **No living memory:** No one alive remembers the original events, only stories
- **Distorted histories:** Each side has different version; both claim truth
- **Impossible to resolve:** Original witnesses dead, evidence scattered/destroyed
- **Pride and honor:** Backing down means admitting ancestors lied for 1,200 years
- **Actual stakes:** Lands, artifacts, titles really do matter

---

## Conflict 1: The Sundered Bloodline

### House Starweaver (Aethoria) vs House Silverleaf (Thaldros)

**Original House:** House Starleaf (Pre-Sundering, unified realm)  
**The Split:** Western branch became Silverleaf; Eastern branch became Starweaver  
**Years of Separation:** 1,247 years  
**Current Relationship:** Hostile strangers

#### The Original House Starleaf

Before the Sundering, House Starleaf was among the most powerful noble families in the unified realm. They were scholar-nobles who studied both the stars and the forests, believing celestial and natural magic were two aspects of one truth.

**Pre-Sundering Holdings:**
- The great library at what is now Starfall
- The sacred forests of what is now Silverwood
- The Observatory Citadel (destroyed in Sundering)
- Unified magical traditions spanning both disciplines

**The Family Structure:**
- Two branches: The Star Wardens (astronomers) and Leaf Keepers (forest wardens)
- Brothers ruled jointly: one from observatory, one from forest
- Marriage alliances united both branches
- Shared artifacts and knowledge

#### The Sundering Event (Year 0 CR)

When the cataclysm struck, the family was literally torn apart:

**Eastern Branch (Became Starweaver):**
- Controlled the observatory and star-focused artifacts
- Cut off from western forests immediately
- Library survived but forest knowledge lost
- Evolved into pure astronomical magic focus

**Western Branch (Became Silverleaf):**
- Controlled the sacred forests and nature artifacts
- Lost access to eastern observatory and star charts
- Shifted entirely to forest and fey magic
- Abandoned astronomical studies

**Immediate Aftermath (0-100 CR):**
- Both branches tried to maintain unity across sea
- Communication difficult; grew apart
- Each blamed the other for causing Sundering (family had powerful magic)
- By 100 CR, considered separate houses with shared origin

#### The Divergence (100-600 CR)

As centuries passed, the houses grew more different:

**Starweaver Evolution:**
- Embraced pure intellectual pursuit
- Recorded everything in writing
- Built new observatories
- Forgot forest wisdom
- Elven cultural dominance

**Silverleaf Evolution:**
- Became pragmatic and political
- Oral traditions and fey pacts
- Married into human nobility
- Forgot astronomical lore
- Human-elf integration

**The Schism (327 CR):**
A pivotal moment when Silverleaf heir visited Starfall seeking to reunite knowledge. The Starweavers refused, claiming Silverleaf had "abandoned true magic for politics." Silverleaf returned west insulted, claiming Starweaver had "lost touch with living magic."

After 327 CR, houses stopped acknowledging kinship entirely.

#### Current Conflict (1247 CR)

**House Starweaver's Claims:**
- They are the "true" continuation of House Starleaf
- Silverleaf abandoned their heritage through human marriages
- Rightful ownership of all original Starleaf artifacts
- Western branch "fell from grace" through political compromise

**House Silverleaf's Claims:**
- They preserved the heart of Starleaf tradition (connection to land)
- Starweaver became isolated ivory tower scholars
- Equal right to all artifacts; they inherited forest holdings
- Eastern branch abandoned practical wisdom for abstract theory

**Disputed Artifacts:**

*The Stellar Crown* - Currently held by Starweaver
- Crown that enhances divination magic
- Silverleaf claims it was created by forest druids, belongs to them
- Starweaver claims it's astronomical artifact, rightfully theirs

*The Greenstar Codex* - Location unknown
- Spell book combining star and forest magic
- Last seen pre-Sundering in the Observatory Citadel
- Supposedly survived; both houses searching
- Whoever finds it gains legitimacy as "true heir"

*The Twin Staves* - One each
- Starweaver has the Star Staff (sapphire-topped)
- Silverleaf has the Leaf Staff (emerald-topped)
- Together they form one incredibly powerful artifact
- Neither will trade or cooperate
- Legends say united staves can "undo the Sundering"

**Modern Tensions:**

Political:
- Silverleaf politically active; Starweaver dismissive
- Each advises their continent's rulers
- Conflicting advice causes diplomatic tension
- Cross-continental treaties difficult due to their opposition

Personal:
- Current heirs have never met
- Some younger family members curious about cousins
- Elders forbid contact ("they are not true kin")
- A forbidden romance would cause massive scandal

Magical:
- Competing magical philosophies
- Students taught the other branch "fell to corruption"
- Magical duels at academic conferences
- Each claims superior understanding of reality

**Reconciliation Possibilities:**

What would it take to reunite them?
1. **Mutual threat:** Something endangering both continents
2. **Artifact recovery:** Finding the Greenstar Codex
3. **Forbidden love:** Heirs fall for each other (scandal!)
4. **Historical proof:** Evidence showing which version of history is true
5. **Third party mediation:** Outsiders (party?) bringing them together

What would reunion mean?
- Combined magical knowledge (star + forest)
- United artifacts (incredible power)
- Political alliance between continents
- Return to "true" Starleaf traditions
- Potential to understand/reverse the Sundering?

## Conflict 2: The Broken Crown

### House Aethermere (Aethoria) vs House Thandris (Thaldros)

**The Core Dispute:** Who are the legitimate successors to the Pre-Sundering High Kingdom?

#### Pre-Sundering: The High Kingdom

Before the Sundering, the realm was united under the High Kings of the First Dynasty. The royal seat was the Crystal Throne in the Palace of Eternal Spring—now at the bottom of the Sundering Sea.

**The Last High King:** King Aldric the Wise
- Ruled from the palace on central landmass
- Had two sons: Prince Theron (elder) and Prince Aethos (younger)
- The Sundering struck during succession crisis
- King and palace destroyed in the cataclysm

**The Succession Crisis:**

Prince Theron (Western Son):
- Military commander; defended western borders
- Favored by military and western nobility
- In the western territories when Sundering struck
- Claimed throne, became founder of Thandris line

Prince Aethos (Eastern Son):
- Scholar and druid; studied with eastern mystics
- Favored by mages and eastern nobility
- In the eastern territories during Sundering
- Claimed throne, became founder of Aethermere line

**Both claimed the other died in Sundering; both were wrong.**

#### The Competing Narratives

**House Thandris Version (Western):**
- Prince Theron was the rightful heir (firstborn)
- King Aldric was going to announce Theron's succession
- Prince Aethos caused the Sundering (forbidden magic experiment)
- Eastern nobles knew Aethos was illegitimate; supported him anyway
- Thandris line are the true High Kings

**House Aethermere Version (Eastern):**
- Prince Aethos was the chosen heir (father's favorite, wiser)
- King Aldric was disappointed in warlike Theron
- Prince Theron caused the Sundering (superweapon gone wrong)
- Western nobles were power-hungry usurpers
- Aethermere line are the true High Kings

**The Truth:** Neither knows for certain; all witnesses died

#### Evidence and Counter-Evidence

**Documents Held by Thandris:**
- Military commission naming Theron as heir apparent
- Western noble testimony supporting Theron's claim
- Records of Aethos's "dangerous" magical experiments

**Documents Held by Aethermere:**
- Royal diary (supposedly King Aldric's) favoring Aethos
- Eastern noble testimony supporting Aethos's claim
- Records of Theron's "reckless" military campaigns

**Problem:** Both sets could be authentic OR forged; no way to verify after 1,247 years

**The Crown Jewels - Split Between Houses:**

*The Sundered Crown* - Broken in two
- Western half held by Thandris (iron and gold)
- Eastern half held by Aethermere (silver and crystal)
- Each half bears half the inscription
- United inscription supposedly reveals "the truth"
- Neither will surrender their half

*The High King's Sword* - Location unknown
- Last seen with King Aldric
- Whoever wields it has symbolic legitimacy
- Supposedly at bottom of Sundering Sea
- Both houses sponsor diving expeditions
- May not even exist anymore

*The Royal Scepter* - Held by Aethermere
- Thandris claims it was stolen during chaos
- Aethermere claims Aethos brought it east legitimately
- Obvious mark of royal authority
- Thandris demands return; Aethermere refuses

#### Modern Implications (1247 CR)

**Political:**
- Neither house recognizes the other's royal authority
- Diplomatic tension between continents
- Trade negotiations complicated by protocol disputes
- Each expects to be treated as superior

**Practical Effects:**
- Cross-continental law unclear (whose jurisdiction?)
- Port Myrthen remains neutral to avoid choosing
- Marriage alliances between continents rare (who outranks whom?)
- Military alliances nearly impossible

**The Succession Question:**
If continents reunified, who would rule?
- Both houses would claim the throne
- Would require war or negotiation
- Neither would accept subordinate position
- Might require outside arbitration
- Or new system entirely (dual monarchy? elected?)

**Recent Developments:**

1205 CR: The Marriage Proposal
- King Thandris proposed marriage alliance
- Offer included recognition of equal royal status
- Queen Aethermere refused (seen as trick)
- Relations cooled further

1243 CR: The Diving Find
- Divers found ancient royal seal near Sundering Sea floor
- Both houses claim it proves their case
- Actually proves nothing; seal predates dispute
- Renewed public interest in conflict

**Moderate Factions:**
Some nobles on both continents think the dispute is ridiculous:
- "It's been 1,200 years; who cares?"
- "We should build new system, not fight over dead kingdom"
- "Both houses are legitimate rulers of their continents"
- These voices are minority but growing

## Conflict 3: The Drowned Fortune

### House Crystalborn (Aethoria) vs House Goldshore (Thaldros)

**The Core Dispute:** Who are the true heirs to House Deepwater, the great merchant dynasty destroyed in the Sundering?

#### Pre-Sundering: House Deepwater

The wealthiest merchant house in the unified realm, House Deepwater controlled all major trade routes and ports. Their headquarters was in the Palace Port—the greatest trading city in the world, located on the central landmass.

**When the Sundering struck, Palace Port sank beneath the waves.**

**The House:**
- Controlled 60% of world trade
- Owned hundreds of ships
- Banking houses in every major city
- Immense wealth (most at Palace Port)

**The Family:**
- Patriarch: Lord Aldris Deepwater
- Eastern branch: Managed eastern trade (became Crystalborn)
- Western branch: Managed western trade (became Goldshore)
- Both branches considered themselves "junior partners"

#### The Sundering (Year 0 CR)

**What Was Lost:**
- Palace Port and the central headquarters
- Lord Aldris and the main family line
- 70% of the house's wealth
- The central bank vaults
- Hundreds of ships
- Trade agreements and contracts
- The family's legal records

**Who Survived:**

*Eastern Branch (Became Crystalborn):*
- Second son Marius Deepwater in Aethoria
- Access to eastern trade networks
- Some ships and goods
- Branch office records

*Western Branch (Became Goldshore):*
- Third daughter Aldris Deepwater in Thaldros
- Access to western trade networks
- Some ships and goods
- Branch office records

**Both claimed to be the legitimate heirs to House Deepwater.**

#### The Competing Claims

**House Crystalborn's Claim:**
- Marius was older than Aldris (daughter)
- Male heir by traditional succession
- House name changed to reflect new magic focus
- Eastern branch always more magically powerful
- They are "evolved" Deepwater, not just remnant

**House Goldshore's Claim:**
- Aldris (daughter) named for grandfather (sign of favor)
- Kept "shore" in name (maintaining continuity)
- Western branch always more commercially successful
- They preserve true Deepwater merchant traditions
- Crystalborn "abandoned" the mercantile heritage

**What They're Really Fighting Over:**

*The Sunken Vaults:*
- Estimated 500,000+ gold pieces at Palace Port bottom
- Magical artifacts from centuries of trade
- Legal documents showing ownership of properties
- Original trade agreements and monopoly charters
- Whoever recovers the vaults gains legitimacy

*Current Holdings:*
- Both houses control trade on their continents
- Neither will recognize other's authority
- Competing over neutral ports (Port Myrthen)
- Sabotaging each other's expeditions

*The Deepwater Name:*
- Neither uses it anymore
- But both claim spiritual succession
- Arguments over which is "true" heir
- Matter of pride and legitimacy

#### The Salvage Wars (100-400 CR)

For 300 years, both houses sponsored diving expeditions:
- Dozens of ships lost to salvage attempts
- Small fortunes recovered
- Each claimed all salvage rights
- Occasional violent confrontations
- Port Myrthen got rich selling supplies to both sides

**Major Incidents:**

237 CR: The Salvage Fleet Battle
- Crystalborn and Goldshore fleets met at dive site
- Refused to yield
- Brief naval skirmish
- Both retreated; neither won
- Increased tensions for century

412 CR: The Great Betrayal
- Goldshore hired Crystalborn divers (secretly)
- Divers stole maps showing vault locations
- Goldshore raided vault first
- Crystalborn discovered betrayal
- Formal state of hostility declared

#### Current Status (1247 CR)

**The Stalemate:**
- Most accessible wealth recovered
- Deep vaults remain unreachable (magic wards? depth? monsters?)
- Both houses wealthy but obsessed with what remains
- Neither will concede the other's right to salvage

**Recent Developments:**

1189 CR: The Water-Speaking Advantage
- Crystalborn developed water-speaking magic
- Gained ability to dive deeper, communicate better
- Goldshore accused them of "cheating" with magic
- Crystalborn countered: "We evolved; you stagnated"

1230 CR: The Kraken Incident
- Goldshore expedition attacked by kraken
- Crystalborn expedition arrived; watched them struggle
- Refused to help
- Goldshore lost three ships
- Hatred intensified

1246 CR: The Map Theft
- Pirates stole ancient map from Goldshore
- Map showed unexplored vault section
- Goldshore claims Crystalborn hired the pirates
- Crystalborn denies it (actually true)
- Cold war threatens to turn hot

**The Heirs:**

Lord Aldris III Goldshore (178, half-elf):
- Obsessed with recovering vaults
- Sees Crystalborn as thieves
- Planning major salvage operation

Lady Aria Crystalborn (234, half-elf):
- Equally obsessed
- Believes Goldshore are greedy pretenders
- Also planning salvage operation

**They're on collision course.**

#### The Deepwater Legacy

What's actually down there?
- Gold and jewels (yes, vast amounts)
- Magical artifacts (powerful and unknown)
- Legal documents (property claims across both continents)
- The Deepwater Ledger (every transaction for 500+ years)
- Lord Aldris's will (names true heir?)
- Something alive? (Palace Port had magical defenses)

**The Truth:**
The will exists and names the true heir—but it's neither house. Lord Aldris left everything to his youngest child, fourth daughter Marina, who was supposedly visiting the southern continent when Sundering struck. She never claimed inheritance; presumed dead.

But what if she survived? What if there's a hidden lineage with legitimate claim to EVERYTHING?

## Conflict 4: The Stolen Relic

### The Celestial Compass - House Starweaver vs Multiple Claimants

**The Artifact:** A navigation device that points not to north, but to "destiny"

**Pre-Sundering:**
- Created by joint effort of multiple houses
- Kept at neutral royal court
- Used to guide kingdom's decisions
- "Points toward the right choice"

**The Sundering:**
- Compass survived somehow
- Ended up in eastern hands (Starweaver)
- Western houses claim it was stolen during chaos
- Eastern houses claim it came east legitimately

**Current Claimants:**
- House Starweaver (current holder) - "Found" it; finders keepers
- House Thandris (Thaldros) - "Royal property; return it"
- House Silverleaf (Thaldros) - "Our ancestor helped create it"
- House Seawatch (Thaldros) - "It was on our family ship when Sundering hit"

**The Problem:**
- All claims could be legitimate
- No way to verify after 1,247 years
- Compass valuable (points to destiny)
- Symbolic value (whoever holds it is "destined to lead")
- Multiple parties want it

**Current Situation:**
- Starweaver refuses to discuss returning it
- Western houses grumble but can't do anything
- Occasional theft attempts
- Diplomatic incidents
- Actually valuable for navigation AND divination

# Thaldros - Western Continent

## House Thandris (Dominant - Royal)

**Region:** The Ironspine Holds  
**Seat:** Kaer Thandros (capital city)  
**Rise:** Pre-Sundering bloodline, established as house 612 CR - Present  
**Status:** Dominant (Royal House of Thaldros)  
**Sigil:** Mountain crowned with iron circlet on black field

### History

House Thandris claims descent from the western bloodline of the Pre-Sundering High Kings. Whether this claim is legitimate remains one of the greatest controversies in Tirvandor's history.

**Pre-Sundering Origins (Claimed):**
- Descended from Prince Theron, eldest son of King Aldric the Wise
- Military commander of western territories
- Rightful heir to unified kingdom
- When Sundering struck, claimed throne from western lands

**The Sundering (Year 0 CR):**
According to Thandris history:
- Prince Theron survived when Palace of Eternal Spring sank
- Rallied western survivors and nobles
- Claimed throne as rightful High King
- Eastern nobles (led by Prince Aethos) refused recognition
- Continents too separated to resolve dispute by force

**Early Royal Period (0-612 CR):**
The bloodline survived in fragmented form:
- Multiple claimants to Theron's line
- Western territories fractured into kingdoms
- Generations of small kings and warlords
- Claim to "High Kingship" maintained but not enforced
- 612 CR: Thorin Thandris finally strong enough to unite western territories

House Thandris rose from clan leaders to kings during the Unification Wars (612-670 CR). Originally master craftsmen and warriors of the Ironspine dwarven clans, they combined ancient royal bloodline claims with military might.

The house consolidated power through:
- **Military Strength:** Controlled the mountain passes
- **Economic Control:** Monopoly on mythril mining rights
- **Strategic Marriages:** Allied with every major northern house
- **The Crown Forge:** Possessed the secret to creating artifacts
- **Royal Legitimacy:** Claimed descent from Pre-Sundering High Kings

**Major Events:**
- 612 CR: Thorin I Thandris claims kingship after Battle of Three Peaks
- 698 CR: King Aldric Thandris expands realm to the Heartlands
- 834 CR: Defended realm from massive orc invasion (The Red Winter)
- 1089 CR: Civil war with House Blackwood over succession
- 1156 CR: Dragon attack nearly destroys royal line; rebuilt stronger
- 1205 CR: Marriage proposal to House Aethermere rejected (succession implications)

### Current Status (1247 CR)

**Ruler:** King Aldric IV Thandris (age 52, human)
- Strong but aging ruler
- Three children: Crown Prince Thorin (25), Princess Elara (22), Prince Marcus (19)
- Succession seems secure, but rumors of bastard claim
- Frustrated by Aethermere's refusal to recognize his legitimacy

**Holdings:**
- Kaer Thandros (capital)
- Three major fortresses in Ironspine
- Mining rights to 12 major veins
- Controls the Crown Forge
- Western half of the Sundered Crown (iron and gold)

**Power Base:**
- Royal army of 5,000 professional soldiers
- Alliance network across Thaldros
- Economic control of metalworking
- Claim to Pre-Sundering High Kingship (disputed)

### Conflicts & Alliances

**Allies:**
- House Ironmark (sworn vassals, manage eastern mines)
- House Silverleaf (marriage alliance)
- The Forgemaster's Guild (economic partners)

**Rivals:**
- House Ashborne (dispute over southern territories)
- Remnants of House Blackwood (old rebellion wounds)
- Merchant Council of Crossvale (resist centralized authority)
- **House Aethermere (succession dispute spanning 1,247 years)**

**Tensions:**
- Eastern continent refuses to recognize western royalty
- Diplomatic incidents over protocol (who outranks whom?)
- The Sundered Crown remains divided
- Marriage alliances with Aethoria complicated by succession

### The Royal Claim

**Thandris's Evidence:**
- Military commission documents naming Theron as heir
- Western noble testimony (could be biased)
- Records of Aethos's "dangerous" magical experiments
- Possession of western half of Sundered Crown
- Unbroken line of succession (they claim)

**Aethermere's Counter-Claims:**
- Theron was militaristic and unfit to rule
- King Aldric secretly preferred younger son Aethos
- Thandris "invented" their royal connection centuries later
- Royal Scepter in Aethermere hands proves legitimacy

**The Truth:**
No one knows. All direct witnesses died 1,247 years ago. The dispute is now about pride, politics, and power—not historical accuracy.

**Modern Implications:**
- If continents reunited, who would rule?
- Marriage alliance would unite claims but whose name rules?
- Trade negotiations complicated by protocol disputes
- Each expects deference from the other

## House Ironmark (Dominant - Vassal Lords)

**Region:** The Ironspine Holds  
**Seat:** Deepforge  
**Rise:** 780 CR - Present  
**Status:** Dominant (Sworn to Thandris)  
**Sigil:** Black hammer striking red anvil

### History

Originally a minor dwarven clan, House Ironmark rose to prominence during the Unification Wars by providing superior weapons to Thorin Thandris. Granted eastern mining territories as reward, they transformed from craftsmen to nobility through shrewd management and mining expertise.

**Defining Moments:**
- 780 CR: Thane Borin I Ironmark swears eternal oath to House Thandris
- 893 CR: Discovers the Deepvein mythril deposit (largest known)
- 1089 CR: Remained loyal during Blackwood Rebellion; rewarded with more lands
- 1156 CR: Lost three mines to dragon attack; bankrupted
- 1180-1210 CR: Slowly rebuilt fortune through careful management
- 1243 CR: Current dispute with House Stonefist over newly-discovered vein

### Current Status (1247 CR)

**Ruler:** Thane Borin VII Ironmark (age 287, dwarf)
- Conservative, traditional, wealthy
- Suspicious of surface-dwellers despite human allies
- Three sons in line for succession (traditional dwarf rivalry)

**Holdings:**
- Deepforge (major mining town)
- Seven active mines (three mythril, four iron/silver)
- Warehouse quarter in Kaer Thandros
- Partial ownership of three merchant ships

**Power Base:**
- Mining expertise and equipment
- Loyal dwarf workforce (700+ miners)
- Economic control of rare metal supply
- Deep coffers (recovered from dragon losses)

### Conflicts & Alliances

**Allies:**
- House Thandris (sworn vassals, unbreakable bond)
- The Delver's Coalition (mining guild)
- Various dwarf clans across Ironspine

**Rivals:**
- House Stonefist (mythril vein dispute, generational grudge)
- House Goldshore (competing for shipping contracts)
- Underground duergar clans (territorial conflicts in deep mines)

## House Blackwood (Extinct/Fallen - Lost Claimant)

**Region:** The Silverwood (formerly)  
**Seat:** Raven's Keep (ruins)  
**Rise:** 587-1089 CR  
**Status:** Officially Extinct (Rumored Survivor)  
**Sigil:** Black tree with silver ravens on green field

### History

Once the most powerful house in the Silverwood, House Blackwood was ancient even before the Unification Wars. They claimed descent from First Men who settled Thaldros after the Sundering, and their bloodline carried traces of fey ancestry that manifested as unusual magical talents.

During the Unification Wars, they sided with Thandris but always maintained independence. As the Thandris kings centralized power, Blackwood chafed under increasing royal authority. The tension exploded in 1089 CR.

**The Blackwood Rebellion (1089-1092 CR):**
- Lord Aldric Blackwood claimed the throne through his grandmother's royal blood
- Civil war split Thaldros; half the nobility backed Blackwood
- Initial victories gave Blackwood control of Silverwood and Heartlands
- 1092 CR: Battle of Raven's Keep—Blackwood forces crushed
- Lord Aldric and all known heirs executed for treason
- Raven's Keep burned, lands distributed to loyalist houses
- Blackwood name forbidden; family line declared extinct

**Post-Rebellion:**
- 1092-1150 CR: Remaining Blackwood sympathizers hunted down
- Family vaults plundered, histories destroyed, lands renamed
- Any Blackwood descendant found was "disappeared"
- The Silverwood never fully recovered from the civil war's devastation

### Current Status (1247 CR)

**Official:** Extinct—no living members  
**Rumored:** A hidden heir survived, protected by loyalist house  
**Lands:** Distributed among houses Thandris, Ironmark, and Silverleaf  
**Legacy:** Name still whispered in Silverwood; some consider them heroes

### The Lost Heir

Persistent rumors claim:
- Lady Elara Blackwood was pregnant when captured; child born in secret before her execution
- A baby was smuggled out of Raven's Keep before final battle
- One of the "executed" heirs was actually a body double
- Blackwood gold and artifacts were hidden and await rightful heir

The most credible rumor: A child was raised by woodsman family in deep Silverwood, given false name, told nothing of heritage until adulthood. Now in their 30s, this person may not even know who they truly are.

### Conflicts & Alliances

**Living Enemies:**
- House Thandris (executed their family)
- House Ironmark (stayed loyal to Thandris)
- Anyone who gained Blackwood lands

**Potential Allies:**
- Old Blackwood loyalists (aging but still bitter)
- Those who profit from instability
- Houses that secretly resented Thandris centralization
- The Fey of Silverwood (blood connection)

## House Silverleaf (Dominant - Forest Lords)

**Region:** The Silverwood  
**Seat:** Silverpine (major city)  
**Rise:** Pre-Sundering (originally House Starleaf, western branch) - Present  
**Status:** Dominant (Controls Silverwood)  
**Sigil:** Silver leaf on green and white quarters

### History

House Silverleaf's true origins predate the Sundering itself. They are the western remnant of the ancient House Starleaf, torn from their eastern kin when the continents split 1,247 years ago.

**Pre-Sundering (Before Year 0):**
- Part of unified House Starleaf (scholar-nobles studying stars and forests)
- Western branch: The Leaf Keepers (forest wardens and nature magic)
- Held sacred forests and managed fey relationships
- Shared power with eastern branch (Star Wardens)

**The Sundering (Year 0 CR):**
- Continent split separated them from eastern observatory
- Lost access to star charts and astronomical magic
- Retained forest holdings and fey pacts
- Began independent evolution as "Silverleaf"

**Post-Sundering Evolution (0-450 CR):**
- Tried maintaining contact with eastern branch (became Starweaver)
- Communication failed; houses grew apart
- Adapted to western politics and human kingdoms
- Abandoned astronomical studies; focused purely on forest magic
- 327 CR: Attempted reunion rejected by Starweaver; formal split
- 450 CR: Officially adopted name "Silverleaf" (from Starleaf)

Unlike most elven houses that shun human politics, Silverleaf pragmatically allied with House Thandris early during the Unification Wars, securing their autonomy through cooperation rather than conflict.

**Key Strategies:**
- Never resisted Thandris expansion—offered alliance instead
- Marriage ties to multiple human houses (half-elf heirs)
- Economic control through lumber, herbs, and forest magic
- Military neutrality but strategic positioning

**Major Events:**
- 670 CR: Formally recognized as Lords of Silverwood by King Thorin II
- 893 CR: Remained neutral during orc invasions (controversial)
- 1089 CR: Stayed neutral during Blackwood Rebellion (even more controversial)
- 1105 CR: Married into House Thandris to repair reputation

**Status:** Declining (Losing to House Ironmark)  
**Sigil:** Clenched stone fist on grey field

## House Heartwood (Dominant - Agricultural Lords)

**Region:** The Heartlands  
**Seat:** Crossvale  
**Rise:** 698-Present  
**Status:** Dominant (The Breadbasket)  
**Sigil:** Golden wheat sheaf on green field

**Tensions:**
- Children squabble over favorite regions
- Merchants want to break grain monopoly

## House Emberthorn (Fallen - Volcanic Lords)

**Region:** The Ashfall Barrens  
**Seat:** Ashgate (formerly)  
**Rise:** 920-1156 CR  
**Status:** Fallen (Near extinct)  
**Sigil:** Red rose engulfed in flames

### History

House Emberthorn rose to power during the volcanic settlement period, mastering the art of living in the Ashfall Barrens. They controlled the region's volcanic forges, obsidian quarries, and unique resources. They were wealthy, powerful, and growing—until the dragon came.

**The Dragon's Wrath (1156 CR):**
- Ancient red dragon Infernalix emerged from volcanic chamber
- Claimed the Barrens as her territory
- Demanded tribute; Emberthorn refused
- Dragon destroyed half their holdings in a single day
- Family fortunes destroyed, fortress burned

## House Seawatch (Declining - Coastal Guardians)

**Region:** The Shattered Shore  
**Seat:** Stormhaven  
**Rise:** 780-Present  
**Status:** Declining (Overshadowed by Goldshore)  
**Status:** Sigil:** Grey tower on stormy sea

### History

Founded as military house to defend against coastal raids, House Seawatch once controlled the entire Shattered Shore. They built fortresses, maintained navy, and protected trade routes. But as threats decreased and trade increased, merchant houses (especially Goldshore) became more important.

**The Decline:**
- 780-900 CR: Height of power; pirates and raiders constant threat
- 900-1000 CR: Threats decreased; military house less needed
- 1000-1100 CR: Merchant houses grew wealthy; Seawatch relied on royal stipend

- Refuses to adapt to merchant-dominated world
- Two sons (both competent sailors, both broke)

**Holdings:**
- Stormhaven (fortified town)

- Small naval squadron (12 ships, aging)
- Lighthouse network (valuable but not profitable)

**Power Base:**
- Naval expertise and tradition
- Strategic fortresses
- Respect from common sailors
- Royal navy connections

### Conflicts & Alliances

**Allies:**
- House Thandris (royal navy ties)
- Naval officers and common sailors
- Minor coastal houses

**Rivals:**
- House Goldshore (economic competition; lost)
- Pirates (constantly raiding)
- Merchant houses (don't need military protection anymore)

# Aethoria - Eastern Continent

## House Starweaver (Dominant - Celestial Dynasty)

**Region:** The Starwood  
**Seat:** Starfall (major city)  
**Rise:** Pre-Sundering (originally House Starleaf, eastern branch) - Present  
**Status:** Dominant (Ancient Power)  
**Sigil:** Silver star web on midnight blue

### History

House Starweaver's true origins predate the Sundering itself. They are the eastern remnant of the ancient House Starleaf, torn from their western kin when the continents split 1,247 years ago.

**Pre-Sundering (Before Year 0):**
- Part of unified House Starleaf (scholar-nobles studying stars and forests)
- Eastern branch: The Star Wardens (astronomers and astral magic)
- Held the Great Observatory and celestial artifacts
- Shared power with western branch (Leaf Keepers)
- Believed star and forest magic were unified truth

**The Sundering (Year 0 CR):**
- Continent split separated them from western forests
- Lost access to sacred groves and fey pacts
- Retained observatory and star charts
- Began independent evolution as "Starweaver"
- The Observatory Citadel partially destroyed but rebuilt

**Post-Sundering Evolution (0-450 CR):**
- Tried maintaining contact with western branch (became Silverleaf)
- Communication failed over generations; houses grew apart
- Adapted to purely astronomical and intellectual focus
- Abandoned forest magic; focused on celestial power
- 327 CR: Western branch visited seeking reunion; Starweaver refused ("they abandoned true magic")
- 450 CR: Officially adopted name "Starweaver" (from Starleaf)

Unlike western houses focused on military power or wealth, Starweavers accumulate KNOWLEDGE. Their libraries contain pre-Sundering texts, star charts spanning millennia, and prophecies written in starlight.

**Philosophy:**
- Knowledge is true power
- The stars reveal destiny
- Magic flows from cosmic forces
- Long-term planning (think in centuries)
- Intellect over emotion (Western branch "fell" to politics and passion)

**Major Achievements:**
- Predicted the Sundering (records sealed—why didn't they warn anyone?)
- Maintain most complete pre-Sundering library
- Trained half of Aethoria's court wizards
- Discovered three new planes of existence
- Predicted every major Aehorian war (after it was too late to prevent)
- Preserved the Star Staff and Stellar Crown

### Current Status (1247 CR)

**Ruler:** Archmagister Elaris Starweaver (age 612, elf)
- Master of astral magic and divination
- More interested in stars than politics
- Considers current events "brief fluctuations"
- Dismisses western branch as "fallen from grace"
- Knows family's pre-Sundering history intimately

**Heir:** Lumina Starweaver (age 156, elf)
- More politically engaged than father
- Believes knowledge should be shared (radical idea)
- Secretly writing accessible versions of house secrets
- Curious about western cousins (forbidden topic)
- Questions whether schism was necessary

**Holdings:**
- Starfall (major city, population ~6,500)
- The Grand Observatory (largest telescope in world)
- The Celestial Archives (forbidden library with pre-Sundering texts)
- Three wizard towers across Aethoria
- **The Star Staff** (sapphire-topped, half of Twin Staves)
- **The Stellar Crown** (disputed ownership with Silverleaf)
- **The Celestial Compass** (claimed by multiple western houses)

**Power Base:**
- Magical knowledge and expertise
- Trains most Aehorian wizards
- Predicts events (sometimes)
- Controls access to ancient knowledge
- Pre-Sundering legitimacy

### Conflicts & Alliances

**Allies:**
- House Aethermere (marriage alliance, shared magical interests)
- The Arcane Colleges
- Other scholarly houses

**Rivals:**
- House Thornveil (believe knowledge should be free)
- Those tired of vague prophecies
- Practical-minded houses who want actions, not predictions
- **House Silverleaf (ancient family feud across the sea)**

**Tensions:**
- Heir's belief in sharing knowledge threatens family power
- Some predictions going wrong recently (concerning)
- Other houses tired of "we foresaw this" after disasters
- The stars are showing something terrible coming
- **The Silverleaf estrangement (unresolved after 1,200 years)**

### Pre-Sundering Legacy

**The Split That Never Healed:**
- Eastern branch (Starweaver) chose scholarship and purity
- Western branch (Silverleaf) chose pragmatism and politics
- Neither recognizes the other as legitimate successors to Starleaf
- 327 CR: Refused reunion attempt; called western branch "corrupted"
- Starweaver believes they are the TRUE continuation of House Starleaf

**Starweaver's Justification:**
- "We preserved the intellectual tradition"
- "They married humans and abandoned elven wisdom"
- "We kept the observatory and star knowledge"
- "They chose politics over truth"
- "We are what Starleaf was meant to become"

**Disputed Artifacts:**
- **The Star Staff:** Starweaver's half of the Twin Staves
- **The Stellar Crown:** Currently held by Starweaver; Silverleaf claims it was forest druids' creation
- **The Greenstar Codex:** Lost; both houses searching desperately
- **The Celestial Compass:** Starweaver holds it; multiple western houses claim theft

**The Artifacts' Power:**
*The Twin Staves:*
- Star Staff (sapphire) + Leaf Staff (emerald) = immense power
- Legend: United staves could "undo the Sundering"
- Neither house will negotiate
- Some say the staves WANT to be reunited

*The Greenstar Codex:*
- Spell book combining star and forest magic
- Written by the original Starleaf founders
- Last seen in Observatory Citadel pre-Sundering
- Supposedly survived the cataclysm
- Contains the "true path" both branches lost
- Whoever finds it gains legitimacy

*The Stellar Crown:*
- Enhances divination and astral magic
- Starweaver claims: "Made by Star Wardens, ours by right"
- Silverleaf claims: "Made by forest druids who channeled starlight"
- Actually could have been collaborative creation
- Symbolically important to both houses

**Modern Attitude:**
- Officially: "Silverleaf are fallen pretenders to Starleaf legacy"
- Privately: Some elders remember they're kin (conflicted)
- Younger generation intensely curious about cousins
- Heir Lumina secretly fascinated by forest magic
- Forbidden to make contact; doing so is exile-worthy offense

## House Aethermere (Dominant - Forest Throne)

**Region:** The Emerald Deeps  
**Seat:** Aethermere (capital city)  
**Rise:** Pre-Sundering (descended from Prince Aethos) - Present  
**Status:** Dominant (Royal House of Aethoria)  
**Sigil:** Golden world-tree on green field

### History

House Aethermere claims descent from the eastern bloodline of the Pre-Sundering High Kings. They are the royal house of Aethoria, dwelling in the capital city built among world-trees, but their legitimacy remains disputed by their western counterparts.

**Pre-Sundering Origins (Claimed):**
- Descended from Prince Aethos, younger son of King Aldric the Wise
- Scholar, druid, and mystic who studied with eastern sages
- Father's favorite (according to Aethermere history)
- Wiser and more suited to rule than warlike brother Theron
- When Sundering struck, claimed throne from eastern lands

**The Sundering (Year 0 CR):**
According to Aethermere history:
- Prince Aethos survived when Palace of Eternal Spring sank
- Rallied eastern survivors and established rule
- Claimed throne as rightful High King
- Western nobles (led by Prince Theron) refused recognition
- Continents too separated to resolve dispute by force

**Eastern Royal Period (0-Present):**
Unlike western Thandris line that fragmented for centuries, Aethermere claims unbroken succession:
- Prince Aethos founded royal line in Emerald Deeps
- Chose world-trees as seat (symbolic: rooted, growing, eternal)
- Ruled through wisdom and magical authority rather than conquest
- Each ruler "chosen by the forest" (complicated succession)
- Maintained claim to High Kingship even as west refused recognition

**Governing Philosophy:**
The royal house of Aethoria rules differently than western kings:
- Rule through wisdom, not force
- The forest is sacred; they are its voice
- Magic should flow naturally
- Harmony between civilization and nature
- Decisions made through councils (lengthy)
- Territory boundaries fluid and debated
- More like first among equals than absolute monarchs

**Different from Western Rule:**
- No standing army (druids and rangers serve when needed)
- No conquest or expansion
- Magical authority more important than military
- Nature itself legitimizes their rule
- The world-trees "chose" them

**Major Events:**
- 0 CR: Prince Aethos establishes eastern throne
- 200-400 CR: Formalized succession system (forest chooses)
- 587 CR: First non-blood heir chosen by world-trees (controversial)
- 1089-1092 CR: House Splittide rebellion (fey war)
- 1205 CR: Rejected Thandris marriage proposal (succession implications)
- 1247 CR: Current queen childless; chosen heir is half-elf (controversial)

### Current Status (1247 CR)

**Ruler:** Queen Silviana Aethermere (age 543, elf)
- Powerful druid and statesperson
- Beloved by forest, respected by nobles
- Childless by choice (ritual prevents it)
- Chose her heir through world-tree ritual
- Refuses to recognize Thandris royalty

**Chosen Heir:** Theron Aethermere (age 89, half-elf)
- Not blood relation; chosen by world-trees
- Controversial choice (half-elf, not full elf, named after western prince!)
- Brilliant but young and untested
- Some question if forest really chose him or if queen manipulated ritual

**Holdings:**
- Aethermere (capital, population ~38,000)
- Direct authority over Emerald Deeps
- Symbolic authority over all Aethoria
- Sacred groves and world-tree network
- **The Royal Scepter** (from Pre-Sundering High Kings)
- **Eastern half of the Sundered Crown** (silver and crystal)

**Power Base:**
- Connection to the land itself
- Respect from druid circles
- World-tree magic
- Moral authority
- Pre-Sundering royal legitimacy (disputed)

### Conflicts & Alliances

**Allies:**
- House Starweaver (marriage alliances, shared magic)
- The Druid Circles
- Ancient forest spirits

**Rivals:**
- House Thornveil (want more centralized power)
- Human settlements (want development over conservation)
- Those who question half-elf heir
- **House Thandris (succession dispute spanning 1,247 years)**

**Tensions:**
- Chosen heir system creates succession uncertainty
- Some say world-trees are dying (heresy?)
- Western expansion threatening forests
- Theron's youth and half-elf status controversial
- **The western royals refuse to acknowledge eastern legitimacy**

### The Royal Claim

**Aethermere's Evidence:**
- Royal diary (supposedly King Aldric's) showing preference for Aethos
- Eastern noble testimony supporting Aethos's claim
- Records of Theron's "reckless" military campaigns
- Possession of the Royal Scepter (clear mark of authority)
- Possession of eastern half of Sundered Crown
- Unbroken succession (they claim)

**Thandris's Counter-Claims:**
- Theron was firstborn; traditional succession
- Aethos caused the Sundering (forbidden magic experiment)
- The diary is forged
- Royal Scepter was stolen during chaos
- Aethermere "invented" their royal connection

**The Truth:**
No one knows. All direct witnesses died 1,247 years ago. The dispute is now about pride, politics, and power—not historical accuracy.

**Modern Implications:**
- If continents reunited, who would rule?
- Marriage alliance would unite claims but cultural differences vast
- Trade negotiations complicated by protocol disputes
- Each expects deference from the other
- 1205 CR: Thandris marriage proposal seen as "trick to subordinate us"

**The Scepter Dispute:**
- Aethermere: "Prince Aethos brought it east legitimately"
- Thandris: "Stolen during the chaos of Sundering"
- Either could be true
- Symbolically crucial (whoever holds it looks legitimate)
- Thandris demands return; Aethermere refuses

### Pre-Sundering Legacy

**The Price of Division:**
- Two royal lines claiming same throne for 1,200+ years
- Diplomatic impossibility between continents
- Trade hindered by protocol disputes
- Cultural drift makes reunification harder
- Each generation entrenches positions further

**The Crown Problem:**
- Crown split in two when continents sundered
- Eastern half (silver and crystal): Aethermere holds
- Western half (iron and gold): Thandris holds
- United crown supposedly reveals "the truth" via inscription
- Neither will surrender their half
- Both afraid of what full inscription might say

**The High King's Sword:**
- Last seen with King Aldric at Palace of Eternal Spring
- Now at bottom of Sundering Sea
- Symbolically crucial: whoever wields it is legitimate
- Both houses sponsor diving expeditions
- May not even exist anymore
- Finding it could resolve dispute... or make it worse

**Moderate Voices:**
Some nobles on both continents think dispute is absurd:
- "It's been 1,200 years; who cares?"
- "Build new system, not fight over dead kingdom"
- "Both houses are legitimate rulers of their continents"
- These voices are minority but growing
- Younger generation more open to compromise

## House Crystalborn (Dominant - Lake Lords)

**Region:** The Crystalvale  
**Seat:** Crystalbrook (major city)  
**Rise:** Pre-Sundering (originally eastern branch of House Deepwater), reformed 450 CR - Present  
**Status:** Dominant (Water dynasty)  
**Sigil:** Crystal water drop on silver field

### History

House Crystalborn is the eastern remnant of the legendary House Deepwater, the greatest merchant dynasty of the Pre-Sundering era. When Palace Port sank beneath the waves, the eastern branch survived and eventually reformed as House Crystalborn, evolving from merchants into water-speakers.

**Pre-Sundering (Before Year 0):**
- Part of House Deepwater, wealthiest merchant house in unified realm
- Eastern branch managed eastern trade routes
- Second son Marius Deepwater managed eastern operations
- Considered "junior partners" to main house at Palace Port

**The Sundering (Year 0 CR):**
- Palace Port and the Deepwater headquarters sank
- Lord Aldris Deepwater (patriarch) and main line lost
- 70% of house wealth destroyed
- Eastern branch (Marius Deepwater) survived
- Western branch (Aldris the Younger) also survived
- Both branches claimed to be legitimate heirs

**Transformation Period (0-450 CR):**
Unlike western Goldshore which remained merchants, eastern branch underwent dramatic transformation:

- **0-100 CR:** Survival and rebuilding
  - Lost most ships and wealth
  - Retained control of eastern ports
  - Discovered water-speaking talent in the bloodline
  
- **100-400 CR:** The Salvage Wars

  - Water-speaking abilities manifesting in each generation
  - Shifted focus from commerce to mysticism
  - Claimed the great lakes as sacred territory
  - 450 CR: Formally adopted "Crystalborn" name (symbolizing transformation)

**The Water-Speaking Gift:**
Over generations, the eastern bloodline developed rare magical talent:
- Can communicate with water itself
- Sense through any water source
- Purify or taint water
- Command water elementals
- Navigate perfectly by "listening" to currents

**Why the Gift Emerged:**
- Proximity to magical Crystalvale lakes?
- Desperation after losing wealth?
- Always latent, only now expressed?
- Gift from water entities for control of sacred lakes?
- No one knows for certain

**Rise as Water Lords (450-Present):**
House Crystalborn rose from water-speaking mystics who claimed the great lakes of central Aethoria. They combine druidic magic with commerce, controlling all major waterways and trade routes that pass through the lake network.

**Foundation:**
- Water-speakers (rare magical talent)
- Control all major river/lake crossings
- Pure water is valuable commodity
- Trade routes require their permission

**Economic Power:**
- Shipping across lake network
- Purified water export
- Fishing industry
- River trade tariffs

**Historical Milestones:**
- 450 CR: Officially adopted Crystalborn name
- 600-800 CR: Consolidated control of all major lakes
- 1000 CR: Granted nobility by Queen Aethermere
- 1189 CR: Perfected water-speaking techniques (massive advantage over Goldshore)
- 1230 CR: The Kraken Incident—Goldshore attacked; Crystalborn watched
- 1246 CR: Pirates stole Goldshore map; Crystalborn blamed (actually guilty)
- Planning major salvage operation (1247-1248 CR)

### Current Status (1247 CR)

**Ruler:** Lady Aria Crystalborn (age 234, half-elf)
- Powerful water-speaker (can communicate with water)
- Shrewd businesswoman
- Four children competing for succession
- **Obsessed with proving legitimacy as Deepwater heirs**
- Sees Goldshore as greedy pretenders

**Heir (Disputed):**
Four children, succession unclear:
- **Marius II** (eldest son, age 89) - Traditional, wants war with Goldshore
- **Lyra** (eldest daughter, age 76) - Diplomatic, wants negotiation
- **Thane** (second son, age 68) - Radical, wants to forget Deepwater entirely  
- **Silvana** (youngest, age 52) - Most powerful water-speaker; mother's favorite

Two heirs died "accidentally" (actually murdered by siblings)

**Holdings:**
- Crystalbrook (major city, trade hub, pop ~12,000)
- Control of six major lakes
- All river crossings in region
- Shipping fleet (70+ vessels)
- Ancient claim to all Deepwater holdings (disputed by Goldshore)

**Power Base:**
- Economic control of water trade
- Water-speaking magic (monopoly)
- Strategic location (all trade passes through)
- Wealth from tariffs and shipping
- Magical advantage over western branch

### The Deepwater Legacy

**Crystalborn's Claim:**
- Marius was second son; senior to Aldris (third daughter)
- Male heir more legitimate by traditional succession
- They EVOLVED beyond simple merchants (water-magic proves it)
- Rightful heirs to all Deepwater property
- Goldshore are stagnant pretenders clinging to past

**Counter-Claims (by Goldshore):**
- Aldris was named for grandfather (sign of favor)
- Goldshore kept Deepwater merchant traditions alive
- Crystalborn "abandoned" mercantile heritage
- Magic doesn't equal legitimacy
- They are greedy mystics, not merchants

**What's At Stake:**
- Estimated 500,000+ gold at Palace Port bottom
- Magical artifacts from centuries of trade
- Legal documents showing continental properties
- Original trade agreements and monopolies
- The Deepwater Ledger (every transaction for 500+ years)
- Lord Aldris's will (supposedly names true heir)

**The Salvage Advantage:**
- 1189 CR: Perfected water-speaking magic
- Can dive deeper and longer than Goldshore
- Can communicate underwater
- Can sense through water
- Can command water elementals as guardians
- Goldshore accuses them of "cheating" with magic

**The Salvage Wars Continue:**

- Most accessible wealth recovered
- Deep vaults remain sealed (magic? guardians? curses?)
- 1230 CR: Kraken attacked Goldshore fleet; Crystalborn refused to help
- 1246 CR: Crystalborn hired pirates to steal Goldshore maps (denies it)
- Both planning major expeditions (1247-1248 CR)
