## Patterns and Cycles

Tirvandor's history suggests certain patterns:

**Cycles of Prosperity and Catastrophe:** Approximately every 1,000-2,000 years, a major upheaval
**Planar Activity:** Regular increases and decreases in extraplanar incursions
**Magical Tides:** Periods where magic is more or less powerful
**Rise and Fall of Empires:** No empire has lasted more than 500 years

Some scholars believe Tirvandor is approaching another significant change, pointing to:
- Increased planar instability
- Discovery of ancient prophecies
- Unusual monster activity
- Signs and portents reported by seers
- The 1,250th anniversary of the Sundering approaching (in 3 years)

## Lost History

Much knowledge was lost in the Sundering and previous catastrophes:

- The true capabilities of the ancient civilizations
- The fate of many pre-Sundering cities now beneath the Sundering Sea
- The location of legendary artifacts mentioned in fragments
- The complete history of the Divine Silence
- What lies in the ocean depths of the Sundering Sea (Palace Port, etc.)
- The purposes of certain ancient ruins
- The true cause of the Sundering itself

These mysteries drive many adventures and scholarly pursuits in the current age.
