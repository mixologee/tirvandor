# Timeline of Tirvandor - Part 1: Ancient History

**Ages of Myth, Dawn, Strife, and The Sundering**


---

- **Current Year:** 1247 CR
- **Seasons:** Four distinct seasons in most regions
- **Months:** 12 months of 30 days each, with 5-6 festival days between seasons
- **Week:** 7-day cycles

---

## Age of Myth (??-15,000 BS)

The earliest age, shrouded in legend and oral tradition. Few reliable records exist, and most knowledge comes from ancient ruins, prophetic visions, and the fragmented memories of immortal beings.

### The First Creation

According to myth, Tirvandor was once a single landmass, a perfect world where the **Primordials**—entities of pure elemental power—walked alongside the **First Gods**. The land was raw and wild, magic flowing without restraint. The Primordials shaped the terrain through their very existence: volcanoes rose where fire walked, oceans formed from the tears of water, forests grew in the footsteps of life.

**Key Concepts:**
- The world was united, not yet sundered
- Magic was not learned but inherent to all things
- Dragons were born from the blood of the earth
- Giants were created to tend the world-trees
- The first mortal races emerged from elemental unions

### The Dragon Hegemony (~12,000-8,000 BS)

The great dragons rose to dominance, establishing vast territories and amassing knowledge. This was the age of dragon-lords, when mortals were few and scattered. The dragons created the first written languages, established the foundations of arcane magic, and built monuments that would endure for millennia.

**Major Events:**
- The Chromatic Conclave: Five great wyrms divided the world into color-coded domains
- Creation of the first magical artifacts by dragon artificers
- The Dragon Libraries: Repositories of ancient knowledge, some still undiscovered
- The First Dragon War: Chromatic and metallic dragons fought over philosophical differences, scarring the landscape

### The Giant Kingdoms (~8,000-6,000 BS)

As dragons retreated into seclusion, the giant-kin rose to prominence. They built massive cities of stone, established trade networks, and developed their own sophisticated culture. Many ruins in Tirvandor's mountains and deep forests are remnants of this era.

**Major Events:**
- The Ordning System established (still influences giant culture)
- Construction of the Sky Fortresses
- Development of runic magic and stonecraft
- The Giant-Dragon Pact: An uneasy truce that ended the Dragon Wars

---

## Age of Dawn (6,000-3,000 BS)

The rise of the mortal races. Elves, dwarves, and the first humans emerged as significant civilizations, learning from the ruins of their predecessors and developing their own cultures.

### The First Elven Kingdom (~6,000-4,500 BS)

The elves of Aethoria discovered the ley line nexuses and learned to work with the natural magic of the world-trees. They established the first true elven kingdom, **Lothlindor**, which encompassed most of what is now the Emerald Depths.

**Major Developments:**
- Elven high magic reaches its first flowering
- The Singing Groves planted (some still exist)
- First contact with the Feywild
- Development of elven crafts (woodworking, poetry, star-reading)

### The Dwarven Delving (~5,500-4,000 BS)

The dwarves discovered the Ironspine Mountains and began their great delving into the stone. They uncovered veins of magical ore and ancient giant ruins, claiming both as their own and establishing the underground kingdoms.

**Major Developments:**
- Foundation of Khaz-Durath (the First Deep Kingdom)
- Discovery of mithril and adamantine
- Development of runic forging techniques
- First conflicts with underground horrors (aberrations, mind flayers)

### The Human Emergence (~5,000-3,500 BS)

Humans, shorter-lived but adaptable, spread rapidly across both continents. They learned from elves and dwarves but developed their own distinct cultures and approaches to magic.

**Major Developments:**
- Nomadic human tribes settle into agricultural communities
- Development of divine magic through worship of the gods
- First human kingdoms in central Thaldros
- Cultural exchange between races

### The Age of Accord (~3,500-3,000 BS)

A brief period of relative peace and cooperation between the major races. Trade flourished, knowledge was shared, and great works were accomplished through cooperation.

**Major Achievements:**
- The Accords of Unity: Treaties establishing borders and trade rights
- Mixed-race cities founded
- The Great Library of Silverpine established (later rebuilt after the Sundering)
- Magical research advances, combining different traditions

---

## Age of Strife (3,000-1,000 BS)

The longest and darkest age in recorded history. Wars, plagues, and supernatural catastrophes plagued Tirvandor, culminating in the Sundering itself.

### The First Planar Incursions (~3,000-2,800 BS)

Portals to other planes began opening spontaneously across Tirvandor. Demons, devils, and aberrations spilled into the world. The causes remain debated—some blame reckless magical experimentation, others believe the planes themselves were shifting.

**Major Events:**
- The Demon Wars: Centuries-long conflict against extraplanar invaders
- Formation of the first paladin orders
- Mass casualties across all civilizations
- Permanent planar scars left in some regions

### The Wizard Wars (~2,700-2,400 BS)

In the aftermath of the planar incursions, mage-lords vied for power, each seeking to fill the void left by weakened kingdoms. They raised armies, twisted landscapes with wild magic, and created weapons of terrible power.

**Major Events:**
- Rise and fall of multiple mage-lord dynasties
- Creation of many dangerous magical zones and corrupted lands
- The Spellplague: A magical disease that killed thousands of arcane practitioners
- The First Warforged: Created as soldiers, they would later seek independence

### The Divine Silence (~2,400-2,200 BS)

The gods stopped answering prayers. Divine magic waned, and priests lost their powers. Theories abound about the cause—some say the gods were fighting their own war, others that mortals had displeased them, still others that something was blocking the divine connection.

**Impact:**
- Collapse of theocratic governments
- Rise of arcane magic to fill the void
- Social upheaval and loss of faith
- When the gods returned, their messages had changed

### The Age of Tyrants (~2,200-1,500 BS)

With divine magic weakened and societies fractured, powerful individuals seized control. Lich-kings, vampire lords, and mind flayer colonies established dominions over large regions.

**Major Tyrants:**
- Zalthar the Undying: Lich-king who ruled the Sundaran region for 300 years
- The Crimson Court: A cabal of vampires who controlled central Thaldros
- The Colony of K'thrax: Mind flayers who enslaved portions of eastern Aethoria
- Morveth Shadowmane: A dragon who re-established draconic rule in the mountains

**Resistance:**
- Underground movements kept hope alive
- Heroes emerged to fight the tyrants
- Secret orders preserved knowledge and trained warriors
- Slow, costly reclamation of freedom

### The Great Dying (~1,500-1,300 BS)

A plague unlike any before swept across both continents. Neither magical nor entirely natural, it killed indiscriminately and left vast regions depopulated. This weakened the remaining tyrants but also civilization itself.

**Impact:**
- Population reduced by an estimated 60-70%
- Entire cities abandoned
- Loss of knowledge as scholars and craftsmen died
- Breakdown of trade networks
- Forests reclaimed agricultural land

### Precursors to the Sundering (~1,200-1,000 BS)

As civilizations slowly recovered, tensions grew between those who wanted to restore the old ways and those who sought to forge something new. Philosophical and political differences escalated into conflict.

**The Schism:**
- Western nations favored hierarchical structures and aggressive expansion
- Eastern nations emphasized balance with nature and contemplation
- Religious disagreements about the nature of the Divine Silence
- Control of ley line nexuses became a strategic goal

---

## The Sundering (Year 0)

The cataclysmic event that defines Tirvandor's modern history. The exact causes remain debated, but the consequences were unmistakable—the continent was torn in two, creating the Sundering Sea and reshaping reality itself.

### The Event

The Sundering occurred over the course of three days, each more catastrophic than the last.

**First Day - The Trembling (Year 0 CR):**
- Earthquakes across the entire continent
- Buildings collapsed, mountains shifted
- Ley lines began to destabilize

**Second Day - The Breaking (Year 0 CR):**
- The ground began to split
- Massive fissures opened across the central regions
- Reality itself seemed to crack—planar boundaries weakened

**Third Day - The Separation (Year 0 CR):**
- The two halves of the continent completed their separation
- The Sundering Sea rushed in to fill the gap
- Magical storms raged for weeks
- Thousands of refugees sought safety

**Immediate Aftermath:**
- Estimated death toll: 30-40% of the surviving population
- Complete disruption of civilization
- Loss of central regions that now form the seafloor
- Creation of new coastlines and the island chains

### Specific Losses and Survivors (Year 0 CR)

**Royal Lines Sundered:**
- **Palace of Eternal Spring destroyed,** sinks beneath waves with King Aldric the Wise
- **King Aldric the Wise and main royal line** perish in the catastrophe
- **Prince Theron (West)** survives in western territories, claims throne as High King
- **Prince Aethos (East)** survives in eastern lands, establishes eastern throne
- Beginning of 1,247-year succession dispute that continues to present day

**House Deepwater Shattered:**
- **Palace Port** (greatest trading city in world, House Deepwater HQ) **sinks beneath waves**
- **Lord Aldris Deepwater and main family line** lost with the city
- **70% of house wealth destroyed** in single catastrophic day
- **Eastern branch** (Marius Deepwater) survives in Aethoria
- **Western branch** (Aldris the Younger) survives in Thaldros  
- Both branches claim legitimate succession to Deepwater legacy
- **Goldreach becomes primary surviving western port**

**House Starleaf Divided:**
- **House split** when continents separated, severing ancient family
- **Observatory Citadel partially destroyed** in Aethoria (eastern branch)
- Eastern branch retains star charts, celestial artifacts, astronomical knowledge
- Western branch retains sacred forests, fey pacts, nature magic
- **Silverpine (west) cut off from eastern kin**
- Beginning of divergence that creates House Starweaver (east) and House Silverleaf (west)

**Geographic Transformation:**
- Central regions now form Sundering Sea floor (miles deep)
- New jagged coastlines created on both continents
- Mountain peaks become island chains and archipelagos
- Ley line network permanently disrupted

### Theories on the Cause

Scholars and mages have debated for over a thousand years what caused the Sundering:

**The Weapon Theory:** The most popular belief—that a magical weapon of unprecedented power was detonated, intentionally or accidentally, as a final act in an escalating war.

**The Divine Intervention Theory:** That the gods themselves sundered the continents to separate warring factions and prevent total annihilation.

**The Natural Magic Theory:** That the ley line network became unstable due to centuries of abuse, causing a catastrophic magical earthquake.

**The Planar Collision Theory:** That Tirvandor briefly overlapped with another plane of existence, and the Sundering was reality correcting itself.

**The Dragon Prophecy Theory:** That ancient dragons foresaw the Sundering and actually facilitated it to preserve the world from a greater threat.

The truth may involve elements of multiple theories, or none at all.

## Patterns and Cycles

Tirvandor's history suggests certain patterns:

**Cycles of Prosperity and Catastrophe:** Approximately every 1,000-2,000 years, a major upheaval
**Planar Activity:** Regular increases and decreases in extraplanar incursions
**Magical Tides:** Periods where magic is more or less powerful
**Rise and Fall of Empires:** No empire has lasted more than 500 years

Some scholars believe Tirvandor is approaching another significant change, pointing to:
- Increased planar instability
- Discovery of ancient prophecies
- Unusual monster activity
- Signs and portents reported by seers
- The 1,250th anniversary of the Sundering approaching (in 3 years)

---

## Lost History

Much knowledge was lost in the Sundering and previous catastrophes:

- The true capabilities of the ancient civilizations
- The fate of many pre-Sundering cities now beneath the Sundering Sea
- The location of legendary artifacts mentioned in fragments
- The complete history of the Divine Silence
- What lies in the ocean depths of the Sundering Sea (Palace Port, etc.)
- The purposes of certain ancient ruins
- The true cause of the Sundering itself
