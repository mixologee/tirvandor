# Introduction to Tirvandor

Welcome to **Tirvandor: The Realm of Deep Magic**, a comprehensive campaign setting for Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition. This world combines the mythic grandeur of Tolkien's legendarium with the grounded realism of political intrigue and moral complexity.

## What is Tirvandor?

Tirvandor is a world divided—two great continents separated by the Sundering Sea, each representing different philosophies of civilization and magic. In the east lies **Thaldros**, a militaristic empire built on order and central authority. In the west sprawls **Aethoria**, a confederation of free cities valuing independence and democratic ideals.

Between them stretch the **Contested Lands**, a war-torn frontier where neither power holds sway, and adventurers find both opportunity and danger.

## Core Themes

### Grounded Realism
While magic exists and shapes the world, Tirvandor emphasizes realistic consequences, political complexity, and morally gray choices. Heroes are not always virtuous, villains may have legitimate grievances, and every decision carries weight.

### Natural Magic
Magic flows through **ley lines**—ancient channels of power crisscrossing the world. Spellcasters who understand these currents can amplify their abilities, but the lines also create nodes of wild magic and unpredictable effects.

### Political Intrigue
The great powers of Tirvandor—kingdoms, noble houses, guilds, and secret societies—all pursue their own agendas. Players will navigate webs of alliance and betrayal as they shape the world's future.

### Historical Depth
Tirvandor has a rich history spanning thousands of years, from the Age of Precursors through the devastating Sundering to the present day. Ancient ruins, lost civilizations, and lingering curses all tie back to this deep past.
