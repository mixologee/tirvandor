# Thaldros - Western Continent

## Major Cities

### Kaer Thandros (Capital) ★★★

**Population:** ~45,000 (60% human, 30% dwarf, 10% other)  
**Region:** The Ironspine Holds  
**Ruler:** King Aldric IV Thandris

#### Visual Overview

Kaer Thandros is a fortress-city carved into and built upon the living rock of the Ironspine Mountains. The city rises in tiers, with massive stone walls separating each level. Smoke from countless forges rises into mountain air, carrying the rhythmic ring of hammers on anvils. The architecture blends human ambition with dwarven mastery—towering spires grow from mountain stone, connected by bridges that span dizzying chasms.

The city glows at night with forge-light, creating an orange haze visible for miles. By day, sunlight glints off mythril-reinforced walls and reflects from thousands of windows cut into the mountain face. The Royal Palace crowns the highest tier, its battlements seeming to touch the clouds.

#### Atmosphere

**Above Ground:** Organized military precision. Guards patrol regularly. Citizens move with purpose. The air smells of metal, coal smoke, and mountain wind. Everything is built to last centuries. There's pride here—this city has withstood dragon fire and remained unconquered.

**Underground:** Ancient, cavernous, eternal. The Deep Halls echo with dwarvish songs. Centuries of tradition weigh heavy in the stone. Temperature rises as you descend. The deepest levels hum with old magic and older secrets.

#### Districts

**Region:** The Silverwood  
**Rulers:** Lord Elenion Silverleaf (487, elf) and Lady Silvara Silverleaf (256, elf)

#### Visual Overview

Silverpine doesn't stand apart from the forest—it grows from it. Ancient silver birch trees rise hundreds of feet, their bark gleaming like polished metal. Buildings spiral up trunks, connected by suspension bridges and carved platforms. Elevated walkways wind through the canopy at multiple levels. Only the ground level accommodates humans and traders; the true city exists in the trees above.

Sunlight filters through silver leaves, creating constantly shifting patterns of light. The air smells of pine sap, flowers, and old magic. Everything organic—buildings shaped from living wood, bridges that sway gently, stairs carved from bark that grows as you climb.

At the city's heart stands the **Heart Tree**, a world-tree so massive that twenty people holding hands couldn't circle it. The entire city radiates from this ancient oak.

#### Atmosphere

**Ground Level:** Welcoming to outsiders but clearly "for guests." Markets, inns, trading posts. Humans feel tolerated, not truly welcome. Architecture here is more conventional—wood and stone buildings.

**Canopy Level:** Exclusively elven. Centuries of tradition, slow speech, careful decisions. Time moves differently here. An hour feels like a day, a day like an hour. Priorities are measured in decades, not days.

**Heart Tree:** Sacred. Only elders and druids enter. The presence of something ancient and powerful is palpable. The tree is conscious—everyone feels it.

**Region:** The Goldcoast  
**Ruler:** Lord Aldris III Goldshore (178, half-elf)

#### Visual Overview

Goldreach rises in tiers from a magnificent natural harbor. The city climbs the coastal hills in organized levels—docks at sea level, markets in the middle, wealthy estates on the heights. White limestone buildings with red tile roofs create a distinctly maritime aesthetic. The harbor bristles with masts from hundreds of ships.

The city gleams in sunlight—whitewashed walls, golden domes, brass fixtures polished by sea air. By night, lighthouse beacons and harbor lanterns create a constellation of lights reflected in dark water. Everything smells of salt, fish, tar, and prosperity.

The famous **Golden Harbor** district earned its name from sunset reflections on the water—the entire harbor appears to be liquid gold for about an hour each evening. It's genuinely spectacular.

#### Atmosphere

**Lower District (Docks):** Rough, loud, vital. Sailors from everywhere. Dozens of languages. Fights in taverns. Hard work and harder drinking. Feel like anything could be smuggled, anyone could be hired, any story could be true.

**Region:** The Heartlands  
**Ruler:** Lord Gareth Heartwood (56, human)

#### Visual Overview

Crossvale is a planned city—you can tell immediately. Streets form a perfect grid. Five major roads enter from five directions, meeting at a central plaza. The city sits where three rivers converge, their waters powering forty massive watermills. Everything is practical, efficient, designed for commerce and defense.

Architecture is sturdy timber and stone. No ornate decoration—this is a working city. The walls show scars from civil war (1089-1092 CR), deliberately preserved as warning and memorial. Grain silos dominate the skyline. The massive market plaza can accommodate thousands.

The city smells of fresh bread, grain dust, and hard work. In harvest season, the streets are dusted with wheat chaff. The sound of grinding millstones is constant. This city feeds Thaldros.

#### Atmosphere

Practical, industrious, resilient. These people rebuilt after being besieged seven times. They're proud of surviving, proud of feeding the kingdom, and tired of being fought over. They want to work, trade, and be left alone.

There's a surprising democratic spirit—weekly open councils where any citizen can speak. It's chaotic but genuine. Lord Heartwood governs with consent, not force.

**Region:** The Sundaran Expanse  
**Ruler:** Sultan Rashid Ashborne (41, human)

#### Visual Overview

Sundara rises from the desert like a jeweled oasis. White adobe buildings with colorful tile mosaics reflect blinding sunlight. Domed roofs and minarets reach toward blue sky. Twelve massive palm trees (one for each oasis) tower over the city. Everything is organized around water—the Great Oasis at the city's heart, canals bringing water to every district.

The city is a study in contrasts—scorching heat and cool shade, barren desert and lush gardens, nomadic traditions and permanent architecture. Colorful silk awnings create artificial shade over streets. Glass windows (a local specialty) gleam like gems.

At night, the city cools and comes alive. Lanterns create warm glows. Music drifts from courtyards. The desert stars shine brilliantly overhead.

#### Atmosphere

Exotic, wealthy, tolerant (unusually so). Multiple religions coexist peacefully (revolutionary for Thaldros). Nomadic traditions blend with city life. Families still live in clan structures despite permanent homes. Everyone is tied to one of the founding clans through marriage or adoption.

There's an opportunistic energy—this is a young city (founded 967 CR, 280 years old), still rising, still growing. Fortunes can be made here. The Sultan encourages this (he profits from everyone's success through taxes).

### Ashgate ★★

**Population:** ~12,000 (55% human, 25% dwarf, 15% tiefling, 5% other)  
**Region:** The Ashfall Barrens  
**Ruler:** Warden Council (five members, rotating leadership)

#### Visual Overview

Ashgate is built from black volcanic stone—basalt blocks cut from old lava flows. Everything is dark: black walls, black streets, black buildings. The city sits at the edge of active volcanic region—smoke rises from nearby peaks, the ground is warm underfoot, and the horizon glows red at night from distant lava flows.

Despite the darkness, the city has beauty. Obsidian facades gleam like glass. Hot springs feed public baths where steam rises. Fire opal decorations catch light brilliantly. The architecture is fortress-like—thick walls, small windows, designed to withstand ash falls and heat.

The air smells of sulfur, hot stone, and minerals. Ash drifts down occasionally, coating everything in gray powder. Citizens sweep constantly. The climate is warm year-round—locals find other regions uncomfortably cold.

#### Atmosphere

Frontier, hardy, slightly wild. These people chose to live in a volcanic region—they're not average folk. There's a fatalistic acceptance: "The mountain might erupt, might not. Either way, we're here." Dragon attack (1156 CR) and subsequent occupation shaped the culture—resilient, independent, slightly bitter about being abandoned by the kingdom.

Fire cults operate openly here (illegal most places). Tieflings are welcomed (their heritage makes others uncomfortable, not here). There's an "edge of civilization" feeling—rules are guidelines, authorities enforce what they can.

### Ironhold ★

**Population:** ~8,000 (45% dwarf, 45% human, 10% other)  
**Region:** The Frostmarches  
**Military Governor:** General Borin Stonefist (195, dwarf)

#### Visual Overview

Ironhold is first and foremost a fortress. Built into the Northern Pass, it guards the only viable route through the Frostmarches. Massive walls span the narrow valley. Watchtowers climb the mountainsides. Everything is gray stone, iron reinforcement, and military precision.

The city is vertical—built up the valley walls on terraces. Each level is independently defensible. The temperature is cold year-round; snow covers everything from autumn to late spring. Architecture is blocky, windowless on the outer faces, designed to absorb siege.

This isn't really a city—it's a permanent military camp that civilians live in. The garrison outnumbers civilians. Everything serves the mission: hold the pass, stop invasions from the north, maintain trade route security.

#### Atmosphere

Militaristic, cold (literally and figuratively), disciplined. Soldiers outnumber everyone else. Daily life follows military schedules—bugle calls mark time, patrols are constant, gates open/close on schedule. Civilians here either support the garrison (smiths, bakers, etc.) or are passing through.

There's pride in duty. These soldiers chose the hardest post. They face frost giants, winter wolves, and worse. Ironhold has never fallen. Never.

#### Key Locations

**THE WALLS**
- Span valley, 40 feet thick at base
- Inner and outer walls with killing ground between
- Heated guard towers (magical warmth)

- Make specialty cold-weather equipment
- Dwarven and human smiths work together

**THE SHRINE**
- Military chapel to war gods

- Spartan but sincere
- Officers read names of dead monthly

- **Captain Elena Frostborn** (38, human): Commands north watchtowers, never been warm, volunteered for duty
- **Quartermaster Thordak** (112, dwarf): Manages supplies, genius at logistics, knows exactly how many arrows remain
- **The Ice Witch** (unknown): Hermit living in mountains, sometimes helps garrison, sometimes doesn't, motives unclear

Everything. This is designed for defense:
- Multiple wall layers
- Natural choke point (narrow pass)
- Elevation advantage (shoot down at attackers)
- Stored supplies for year-long siege
- Underground escape tunnels (classified)
- Magical wards against cold, scrying, teleportation
- Rapid response to frost giant raids

- Everything imported except iron (local mine)

# Aethoria - Eastern Continent

## Major Cities

### Aethermere (Capital) ★★★★

**Population:** ~38,000 (65% elf, 20% half-elf, 10% human, 5% other)  
**Region:** The Emerald Depths  
**Ruler:** Queen Silviana Aethermere (432, elf) and Chosen Heir Theron Aethermere (89, half-elf)

#### Visual Overview

Aethermere doesn't just sit in the forest—it IS the forest. The city grows organically from the world-trees themselves. Massive trees hundreds of feet tall form the framework. Buildings are shaped from living wood, grown rather than built. Bridges of woven vines connect platforms at multiple canopy levels. Roots the size of houses create natural archways and chambers.

The entire city pulses with life. Leaves rustle constantly. Luminous fungi provide soft light at night. Flowers bloom year-round. Water flows down bark channels, creating musical streams. The air is thick with growth—green scents, flower perfume, earth and life.

From outside, you might not recognize it as a city. It looks like particularly dense, beautiful forest. Only when you're inside do you realize the trees are organized, the paths deliberate, the structures intentional.

#### Atmosphere

**Ground Level:** Ancient, primal, slightly dangerous. Massive roots create twilight canyons. This is where druids conduct rituals, where nature's power is strongest. Non-elves feel watched by the forest itself.

**Canopy (Middle Levels):** The actual city. Platforms, buildings, walkways all hundreds of feet up. Sunlight filters through leaves. Wind sways everything gently. Elves move gracefully. Others feel precarious.

**Upper Canopy:** Where the nobility and queen reside. Closer to stars. Quieter. More exclusive. View of endless forest in all directions.

**The Heart Tree:** At city center, the greatest world-tree. So massive it dwarfs others. Hollow interior holds the throne room. This tree has consciousness—everyone feels it.

#### Districts

**THE THRONE GROVE** (Heart Tree Interior)
- *Description:* Inside the greatest world-tree. Natural cathedral of living wood. Throne room is chamber within the tree, shaped by growth over centuries.

- **Magic:** Druidic wards, tree magic, connection to fey realm
- **The Trees Fight:** In crisis, world-trees themselves defend city
- **Intelligence:** Rangers monitor all approaches, nothing enters unobserved

### Starfall ★★★

**Population:** ~6,500 (90% elf, 8% half-elf, 2% other)  
**Region:** The Starwood  
**Ruler:** Archmagister Elaris Starweaver (612, elf)

#### Visual Overview

Starfall is a city of spires reaching toward the heavens. Unlike Aethermere's organic growth, Starfall is deliberately constructed—elegant silver towers that gleam in starlight. The architecture is mathematical, geometric, based on celestial calculations. Everything aligns with stars, planets, cosmic forces.

The Grand Observatory dominates—a massive crystal dome where the largest telescope in the world tracks the heavens. Smaller observatories dot the city. Telescopes point skyward from every tall building. At night, the city glows softly with starlight reflected from countless crystals.

The city sits on a plateau with unobstructed view of sky in all directions. Trees have been carefully cleared (controversial with druids). Everything serves astronomical observation and astral magic.

#### Atmosphere

Intellectual, scholarly, isolated (deliberately). This is city of scholars who care more about stars than daily life. Conversations are slow, measured, often involve complex magical theory. Time feels different—measured in cosmic cycles, not days.

There's arrogance here. They believe knowledge is true power, consider themselves superior to "merely political" houses. They predicted the Sundering (supposedly) but didn't warn anyone (why?). They know secrets but share selectively.

Non-scholars feel unwelcome. This is not a city for common folk.

#### Districts

  - **The Prophecy Vault:** Predictions recorded but sealed
  - **The Starleaf Records:** Original family documents from before Sundering
  - **The Study Chambers:** Where scholars research in isolation
  - **The Scripting Hall:** Where new observations are recorded

- **Power:** Information is currency. They know things others don't.

#### Defenses

- **Magic:** Primary defense—wards, illusions, teleportation, divination
- **Intelligence:** They see threats coming (literally)
- **Isolation:** Remote location, difficult to approach unnoticed
- **Star Magic:** Can call on cosmic forces (devastating but rarely used)
- **Warning:** They know when danger approaches—always prepared

### Crystalbrook ★★★

**Population:** ~15,000 (55% elf, 30% human, 15% other)  
**Region:** The Crystalvale  
**Ruler:** Lady Aria Crystalborn (234, half-elf)

#### Visual Overview

Crystalbrook is built around the crystal-clear waters of the Crystalvale lakes. The architecture emphasizes glass and crystal—buildings with crystal windows, glass mosaics, water features everywhere. Canals flow through the city. Fountains sparkle in squares. Everything designed to honor and display water.

The city is beautiful in sunlight—light refracts through crystals creating rainbows, water reflects buildings, glass gleams. At night, magical lights beneath water create ethereal glows. The sound of flowing water is constant—musical, soothing.

The lake itself is unnaturally clear—you can see 100 feet down. Fish swim in crystal waters. Water plants wave in currents. The Crystalborn's water-speaking magic maintains the purity.

#### Atmosphere

Peaceful, mystical, slightly alien. The Crystalborn have evolved beyond normal merchant concerns—they're water-speakers now, mystics who communicate with water itself. Their wealth is in magic, not gold.

There's otherworldly quality. Water-speakers sometimes speak to the lake instead of people. They can sense water sources miles away. They navigate by "listening" to currents. Their magic is beautiful but strange.

Outsiders feel both welcomed (Crystalborn are hospitable) and disconnected (they're having conversations with water you can't hear).

**Region:** Thornmire Marches  
**Ruler:** Council of Speakers (three representatives: human, lizardfolk, elf)

#### Visual Overview

Marshaven exists in seeming defiance of nature—a city built in a swamp. Buildings on stilts rise above murky water. Wooden walkways connect everything. The architecture is vertical by necessity—nothing can rest on soggy ground.

Everything is weathered, stained by swamp water, covered in moss. But it's well-maintained—residents constantly repair, replace, rebuild. The city smells of wet earth, decay, and growth simultaneously. The sound of frogs and insects is constant. By night, bioluminescent swamp life creates eerie glows.

The city looks temporary but has stood 400 years. It's adapted, learned to thrive where others would fail. There's pride in that.

#### Atmosphere

Resilient, adaptive, diverse. This city welcomes those who don't fit elsewhere—lizardfolk, ex-criminals, refugees, odd folk. If you can survive the swamp, you can live here. Merit matters, not background.

There's pragmatic equality—humans, lizardfolk, and elves share power because they must. Swamp doesn't care about race. Survival requires cooperation.

It feels frontier-ish, dangerous, free. Laws are simpler here. Life is harder but more honest.

**Region:** The Wildlands (Deep Jungle)  
**Ruler:** Grove Council (five druids, rotating leadership)

#### Visual Overview

Wildgrove embraces the jungle completely. Buildings are platforms high in trees. Rope bridges connect everything. Thick vines form living walls. The architecture works WITH nature rather than against it.

Everything is green. Constant rain keeps everything wet. Flowers bloom year-round. Insects and birds are everywhere. The jungle's noise is deafening—howler monkeys, parrots, rain, wind in leaves.

You can barely see the city from outside—it's camouflaged, intentional. This keeps it safe from monsters and others who shouldn't find it.

#### Atmosphere

Wild, free, slightly dangerous. This isn't refined elven culture—it's frontier jungle survival. People here chose to live in deep jungle. They're hardy, independent, suspicious of outsiders.

There's primal magic here. Druids are in charge, not nobles. Nature's law applies. Strength matters, wisdom matters, connection to land matters. Civilization's rules are secondary.

### Port Myrthen ★★★

**Population:** ~25,000 (40% human, 20% elf, 15% dwarf, 10% halfling, 15% other)  
**Region:** Myrthen Archipelago (Neutral Territory)  
**Government:** Neutral Council (representatives from both continents)

#### Visual Overview

Port Myrthen is unique—the only major settlement in the island chain between continents. It's neutral territory, belonging to neither Thaldros nor Aethoria. The architecture is deliberately mixed—eastern and western styles blend, creating unique aesthetic.

The harbor is massive, accommodating ships from both continents simultaneously. Docks are divided: western berths on one side, eastern on other, neutral in middle. Everything designed to avoid conflict.

The city rises in tiers from sea level. Stone buildings painted white reflect sunlight. Red tile roofs are universal. Gardens soften stone. It looks peaceful, prosperous, carefully maintained.

#### Atmosphere

Neutral, cosmopolitan, expensive. This is where East and West meet. Treaties are signed here. Trade happens here. Spies operate here. Everything costs more—neutrality isn't cheap.

There's constant tension beneath polite surface. Western and eastern factions watch each other. Merchants compete ruthlessly. Politics are complex—offending either continent could end neutrality.

Everyone is from somewhere else. No one is "from" Port Myrthen originally (except those born here recently). It's a city of immigrants, traders, diplomats, and people escaping their homelands.

#### Districts

#### Economy

- Primary: Trade hub (East-West commerce)
- Secondary: Banking (neutral ground), diplomacy (treaty site), information (spy central)
- Trade: Everything passes through here
- Power: Neutrality itself is valuable—both continents need this place

#### Defenses

**Population:** ~3,500 (75% dwarf, 20% human, 5% other)  
**Region:** Ironspine Holds  
**Ruler:** Thane Borin Ironmark

#### Description

Deepforge lives up to its name—the town descends deep into the mountain. Only the entrance hall and market are on the surface. Everything else is underground, built into a natural volcanic chamber where lava once flowed.

The town uses geothermal heat for forges. Magma flows in sealed channels beneath the smithies, providing endless heat. The air shimmers with heat. The sound of hammers on anvils echoes through stone chambers.

This is a working town—every adult is involved in metalwork somehow. Children learn smithing before reading. The quality of work here rivals Kaer Thandros. Pride is immense.

**Key Locations:**
- **The Lava Forges:** Where volcanic heat powers smithies
- **The Deep Market:** Underground trading hall for metal goods
- **The Sealed Chamber:** Recently broken into something ancient—now sealed by order
- **The Guild Hall:** Where master smiths meet

**Notable NPCs:**

**Region:** The Heartlands  
**Government:** Burgher council

#### Description

Riverdale sits where three rivers meet, controlling water access for the entire region. The town is built on both banks and islands in the middle. Bridges connect everything. Water wheels line the rivers, grinding grain and powering mills.

Everything revolves around the rivers—fishing, transport, water rights, mill operation. The town supplies flour to dozens of surrounding settlements. The sound of flowing water and grinding stones is constant.

Recently flooding has threatened crops. Some suspect sabotage—rival settlements jealous of Riverdale's water control.

### Oakenheart (Thaldros) ★★

**Population:** ~3,200 (50% human, 35% elf, 10% half-elf, 5% other)  
**Region:** The Silverwood  
**Government:** Shared (human mayor and elf elder)

#### Description

Oakenheart is built around a massive ancient oak tree—the Heart Oak, which legend says predates even the elves. The tree is 500 feet tall, 60 feet across. The town radiates from this central tree like spokes from a hub.

The town successfully balances human and elf populations. Humans handle commerce and construction; elves manage the forest and nature magic. It works because the Heart Oak blesses both.

Recently the Heart Oak is dying. Leaves falling prematurely. Bark darkening. Town terrified—if the tree dies, what happens to the town? Some say it's a curse. Others blame deforestation nearby. Elves perform rituals nightly.

**Key Locations:**
- **The Heart Oak:** Ancient tree at town center, sacred to both races
- **The Druid Circle:** Where nature priests tend the tree
- **The Market Ring:** Shops encircling the Heart Oak
- **The Woodworker District:** Where elven crafts are made

- Elder Silverbark (403, elf): Druid, desperately trying to save tree
- Master Carpenter Woodwise (89, half-elf): Bridge between communities
- The Green Children: Three children born same night tree stopped growing—significant?

**Economy:** Woodworking (elven quality), forestry (sustainable), druidic services

**Atmosphere:** Worried, desperate. Everyone loves the Heart Oak. Tension between those who blame each other for its decline.

### Sandstone (Thaldros) ★★

**Population:** ~2,600 (70% human, 15% dwarf, 10% tiefling, 5% other)  
**Region:** Sundaran Expanse  
**Government:** Clan council

#### Description

Sandstone is aptly named—every building carved from local sandstone. The town has a unified aesthetic: red-orange stone, flat roofs, narrow windows to keep out heat and sand. Built around a small oasis, the town serves as vital caravan stop.

During sandstorms, the entire town can seal—doors close, windows shutter, everyone retreats inside. The buildings are built to withstand being buried in sand. After storms, the town digs itself out.

Recently a buried temple entrance was discovered during a storm. Sandstone's elders forbid entry (dangerous), but treasure hunters are gathering. Tension rising.

**Key Locations:**
- **The Oasis:** Small but vital water source
