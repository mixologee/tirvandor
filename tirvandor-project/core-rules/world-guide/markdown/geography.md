# Geography of Tirvandor

**The Realm of Deep Magic**

---

## Overview

Tirvandor is a world where natural magic flows through the very fabric of reality—coursing through ley lines beneath mountains, pooling in ancient forests, and whispering in the depths of forgotten swamps. The realm consists of two major continents separated by a vast ocean, connected by trade routes that thread through archipelagos and island chains. This is a world of grounded realism layered with mythic wonder, where geography shapes culture, magic influences terrain, and the land itself remembers.

**Climate:** Temperate to subtropical, with regional variations
**Magical Saturation:** High in natural areas, moderate in settled regions
**Technological Level:** Medieval with magical augmentation
**Population:** Diverse races across settlements, with concentrations of specific peoples in certain regions

**Total Documented Settlements:** 204

## The Sundering Sea

The vast ocean that separates the two continents of Tirvandor, the Sundering Sea is both highway and barrier. Ancient mariners claim it was created in a cataclysm millennia ago when the continents were torn apart by warring primordial forces. The waters are deep, storm-prone, and unpredictable—respected by sailors and feared by the superstitious.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Deep Trenches:** Underwater chasms of unknown depth where strange magical currents flow
- **Storm Belts:** Semi-predictable regions of violent weather that shift with the seasons
- **Singing Waters:** Certain areas where the waves produce haunting melodies, said to be the songs of drowned civilizations
- **Trade Winds:** Reliable currents that have enabled commerce between continents for centuries

## The Island Chains

Between and around the two great continents lie numerous islands and archipelagos. These serve as stepping stones for trade, havens for pirates and outcasts, and homes to unique cultures that blend influences from both continents.

### The Drifting Chain (Central Archipelago)

The islands between Thaldros and Aethoria are crucial for maritime trade and have developed their own distinct culture—a blend of eastern and western influences.

**Major Islands:**

**Isla Myrthen:**
- **Port Myrthen:** The largest settlement in the archipelago (pop. ~9,000), a cosmopolitan trading port where goods from both continents exchange hands. Known for its relaxed attitude toward laws and neutral political stance. Home to the Merchant's Guild headquarters.

### Other Notable Islands

Many smaller islands remain unnamed on common maps, ranging from lifeless rocks used as navigation markers to hidden refuges for various groups—pirates, exiled nobles, escaped criminals, or those simply seeking solitude. The total number of islands in the archipelagos is estimated at over 100, though fewer than 20 have permanent settlements.

**Thaldros:**
- Mountain passes close in winter
- Desert crossings require experienced guides
- Bandits along less-traveled routes
- Occasional monster incursions from wilderness areas

**Aethoria:**
- Forest paths require rangers or druids to navigate safely
- Swamp regions are nearly impassable without local guides
- Natural magic can cause disorientation
- Territorial creatures and protective druids

**The Sundering Sea:**
- Storm season makes sailing dangerous
- Pirates in the archipelagos
- Sea monsters in deep waters
