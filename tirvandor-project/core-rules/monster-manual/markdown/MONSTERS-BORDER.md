### TACTICS
- Use terrain for ambushes
- Target weakest-looking party member
- Flee when outnumbered or badly wounded
- May surrender if offered mercy

### CAMPAIGN USE

## 2. SMUGGLER CAPTAIN

*Medium humanoid (any race), any alignment*

**Armor Class** 15 (studded leather)  
**Hit Points** 58 (9d8 + 18)  
**Speed** 30 ft.

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 12 (+1) | 16 (+3) | 14 (+2) | 14 (+2) | 12 (+1) | 14 (+2) |

**Saving Throws** Dexterity +5, Intelligence +4  
**Skills** Deception +6, Insight +3, Persuasion +6, Stealth +5  
**Senses** passive Perception 11  
**Languages** Common, Thieves' Cant, plus two others  
**Challenge** 3 (700 XP)

**Cunning Action.** On each of its turns, the captain can use a bonus action to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

**Border Network.** The captain knows safe routes through the Border and has contacts in most settlements. Can call for reinforcements (1d4 border bandits arrive in 1d4 rounds).

**Sneak Attack (1/Turn).** The captain deals an extra 10 (3d6) damage when hitting with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll.

### ACTIONS

**Multiattack.** The captain makes two attacks with their rapier.

**Rapier.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage.

**Hand Crossbow.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.

**Contract Offer (Recharge 5-6).** The captain offers a bargain. One humanoid within 30 feet that can hear the captain must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target is charmed for 1 minute or until the captain or their allies harm it. While charmed, the target is inclined to accept reasonable deals.

### REACTIONS

**Parry.** The captain adds 2 to their AC against one melee attack that would hit them. To do so, the captain must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.

### LORE
Smuggler captains run illicit goods across the Border—weapons, refugees, contraband, and information. They're neutral parties in the conflict, caring only for profit, but their networks make them valuable allies or dangerous enemies.

### TACTICS
- Negotiate before fighting if possible
- Use Cunning Action to stay mobile
- Call for backup if losing
- Always have an escape route planned

### CAMPAIGN USE
**Blood & Coin:** Quest givers, rivals, or allies. May offer lucrative smuggling contracts  
**Shattered Oaths:** Can smuggle refugees or weapons for the resistance (for a price)

## 3. WAR-SCARRED VETERAN

*Medium humanoid (any race), any alignment*

**Armor Class** 17 (half plate)  
**Hit Points** 68 (8d8 + 32)  
**Speed** 30 ft.

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 16 (+3) | 13 (+1) | 18 (+4) | 10 (+0) | 12 (+1) | 10 (+0) |

**Condition Immunities** frightened  
**Senses** passive Perception 11  
**Languages** Common  
**Challenge** 4 (1,100 XP)

**Survivor.** The veteran has advantage on death saving throws.

**Seen It All.** The veteran is immune to being frightened and has advantage on saving throws against being charmed.

**Battle Scarred.** When the veteran takes damage that would reduce them to 0 hit points, they can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a success, they drop to 1 hit point instead. This DC increases by 5 each time this feature is used and resets after a long rest.

### ACTIONS

**Multiattack.** The veteran makes two longsword attacks or two longbow attacks.

**Longsword.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage, or 8 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage if used with two hands.

**Longbow.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d8 + 1) piercing damage.

**Intimidating Presence (Recharge 5-6).** The veteran roars a challenge. Each enemy within 30 feet that can see or hear the veteran must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

### LORE
These veterans have fought in countless Border skirmishes for both sides, mercenary bands, or their own survival. They're hard as nails, cynical, and incredibly difficult to kill. Many become mercenaries, bandits, or hermits.

### TACTICS
- Fight defensively, conserving energy
- Use intimidation to avoid fights
- Know when to retreat (and how)
- Protect allies instinctively

### CAMPAIGN USE
**Blood & Coin:** Mentors, rivals, or elite mercenaries. Often have valuable intel

**Armor Class** 13  
**Hit Points** 67 (9d8 + 27)  
**Speed** 0 ft., fly 60 ft. (hover)

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the wraith has disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

**Border-Bound.** The wraith is bound to the Border region where it died. If forced outside the Border, it takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage at the start of each of its turns.

**Echoes of War.** When the wraith first appears, each creature within 30 feet hears a snippet of the battle where it died (screams, clashing steel, etc.). The wraith can speak one phrase from its final moments.

### ACTIONS

**Life Drain.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 21 (4d8 + 3) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

**Create Specter.** The wraith targets a humanoid within 10 feet of it that died violently in the last minute. The target's spirit rises as a specter under the wraith's control. The wraith can have no more than three specters under its control at one time.

### LORE
Border wraiths are the spirits of soldiers and civilians who died in the countless conflicts in the Border region. They're drawn to battles, feeding on death and violence. Some retain fragments of their former identities and may be laid to rest if their remains are properly buried.

### TACTICS
- Ambush from walls/objects
- Target squishier party members
- Use Create Specter on fallen enemies
- Flee if seriously injured (unless enraged)

### CAMPAIGN USE

**Speed** 30 ft., burrow 30 ft.

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |

| 20 (+5) | 8 (-1) | 20 (+5) | 5 (-3) | 10 (+0) | 5 (-3) |

**Damage Vulnerabilities** thunder

**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., tremorsense 60 ft., passive Perception 10  
**Languages** Terran  
**Challenge** 6 (2,300 XP)

**Earth Glide.** The elemental can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone. While doing so, it doesn't disturb the material it moves through.

**Siege Monster.** The elemental deals double damage to objects and structures.

**Mixed Form.** The elemental's body contains earth from both Thaldros and Aethoria, making it unstable. When the elemental takes damage, roll 1d6. On a 5-6, it erupts, dealing 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage to all creatures within 5 feet.

**Territorial Fury.** The elemental has advantage on attack rolls against creatures that have dealt damage to structures or the earth in the last minute.

### ACTIONS

**Multiattack.** The elemental makes two slam attacks.

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

**Border Quake (Recharge 5-6).** The elemental strikes the ground, creating a localized earthquake. Each creature on the ground within 20 feet must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a success, the creature takes half damage and isn't knocked prone. Additionally, the ground in that area becomes difficult terrain until cleared.

### LORE
These elementals form in the Border region, composed of earth from both nations. The constant conflict and bloodshed has made the land itself angry and unstable. They attack anyone who further damages the land but may ignore peaceful travelers.

### TACTICS
- Emerge from underground (surprise)
- Focus on those damaging terrain
- Use Border Quake to knock down groups
- Retreat underground if badly hurt

### CAMPAIGN USE
**Both:** Environmental hazard, obstacle to overcome, or potential ally if party respects the land

## 6. REFUGEE MOB

*Large swarm of Medium humanoids, any alignment*

**Armor Class** 10  
**Hit Points** 39 (6d10 + 6)  
**Speed** 30 ft.

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 10 (+0) | 10 (+0) | 12 (+1) | 10 (+0) | 10 (+0) | 8 (-1) |

**Condition Immunities** charmed, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, prone, restrained, stunned  
**Senses** passive Perception 10  
**Languages** Common  
**Challenge** 1 (200 XP)

**Swarm.** The mob can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the mob can move through any opening large enough for a Medium humanoid. The mob can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

**Desperate Horde.** The mob has advantage on attack rolls if it has half its hit points or more.

**Panicked.** The mob has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws while below half hit points.

### ACTIONS

**Mob Violence.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +2 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. *Hit:* 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage, or 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage if the swarm has half its hit points or fewer.

### REACTIONS

**Stampede.** When the mob takes damage from an area effect, it can move up to its speed away from the source of danger. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

### LORE
Desperate refugees sometimes form angry mobs, driven by fear, hunger, or manipulation. They're not evil—just desperate people in terrible circumstances. Most will flee or surrender if given the opportunity.

### TACTICS
- Overwhelm through numbers
- Target obvious threats
- Flee if leaders fall or hope is offered
- Can be calmed with Persuasion (DC 15)

### CAMPAIGN USE
**Blood & Coin:** Moral dilemma—they're a threat but also victims  
**Shattered Oaths:** Potential recruits if handled with compassion

---

## 7. SCAVENGER GHOUL

*Medium undead, chaotic evil*

**Armor Class** 12  
**Hit Points** 22 (5d8)  
**Speed** 30 ft.

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 13 (+1) | 15 (+2) | 10 (+0) | 7 (-2) | 10 (+0) | 6 (-2) |

**Damage Immunities** poison  
**Condition Immunities** charmed, exhaustion, poisoned  
**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10  
**Languages** Common  
**Challenge** 1 (200 XP)

**Battlefield Scavenger.** The ghoul has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to find corpses or wounded creatures.

**Pack Tactics.** The ghoul has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the ghoul's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

### ACTIONS

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 9 (2d6 + 2) piercing damage.

**Claws.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (2d4 + 2) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an elf or undead, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Corpse Feast (Recharge 5-6).** If the ghoul is adjacent to a corpse or unconscious creature, it can spend its action feeding. It regains 10 (3d6) hit points.

### LORE
The Border's constant violence creates ample food for ghouls. These undead scavengers lurk near battlefields and ambush sites, waiting for fresh corpses—or making their own.

### TACTICS
- Hunt in packs (2-8 ghouls)
- Target wounded enemies
- Use paralysis on dangerous foes
- Feast mid-combat if possible

### CAMPAIGN USE
**Both:** Common undead encounter in Border region

### ACTIONS

**Multiattack.** The drake makes one bite attack and one tail attack.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage.

**Tail.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

### LORE
These drakes have claimed territories in the Border's ruins and caves. They're aggressive toward intruders but intelligent enough to recognize when they're outmatched. Some mercenary bands have trained them as mounts or guards.

### TACTICS
- Ambush from high ground
- Work in pairs if possible
- Use tail to knock down enemies
- Flee to lair if seriously wounded

### CAMPAIGN USE
**Blood & Coin:** Encountered in ruins, potential to be trained/tamed

**Keen Hearing and Smell.** The beast has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

**Pack Tactics.** The beast has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the beast's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

**Trained Killer.** The beast was trained for war. It has advantage on attack rolls against frightened creatures.

### ACTIONS

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

**Pounce.** If the beast moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a bite attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the beast can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.

**Intimidating Howl (Recharge 5-6).** The beast howls. Each enemy within 30 feet that can hear it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

### LORE
Both armies use war beasts—massive wolves, war dogs, or other predators bred and trained for combat. Some have escaped and gone feral in the Border, becoming apex predators.

### TACTICS
- Hunt in packs (2-5 beasts)
- Use Pounce to knock down targets
- Focus on frightened enemies
- Protect handlers if trained

### CAMPAIGN USE
**Both:** Used by military forces, encountered wild in Border

---

## 10. HAUNTED BATTLEFIELD

*Gargantuan hazard/swarm, chaotic neutral*

**Armor Class** 15  
**Hit Points** 150 (12d20 + 24)  
**Speed** 0 ft.

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 1 (-5) | 20 (+5) | 14 (+2) | 10 (+0) | 14 (+2) | 16 (+3) |

**Damage Resistances** bludgeoning, piercing, slashing  
**Damage Immunities** poison, psychic  
**Condition Immunities** all  
**Senses** blindsight 120 ft., passive Perception 12  
**Languages** understands all languages but can't speak  
**Challenge** 7 (2,900 XP)

**Immobile Hazard.** The battlefield doesn't move. It exists as a 120-foot radius area of lingering death magic and tortured spirits.

**Echo of Battle.** Any creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 14 (4d6) psychic damage and have disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of its next turn as ghostly weapons strike and spectral screams assault it.

**Restless Dead.** At the start of each round, 1d4 spectral soldiers (use specter statblock) manifest within the area. They attack the nearest living creatures and disappear after 1 minute or when reduced to 0 hit points.

**Consecration Vulnerable.** If a cleric or paladin spends 10 minutes performing funeral rites within the area, the battlefield's power is suppressed for 24 hours in a 30-foot radius around the ritual site.

### ACTIONS

The battlefield doesn't take actions in the traditional sense—its effects are constant.

**Phantom Army (Recharge 5-6).** At initiative count 20, the battlefield can summon a phantom army. All creatures in the area see ghostly soldiers fighting and dying around them. Each creature must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 22 (4d10) psychic damage and is frightened until the end of its next turn. On a success, the creature takes half damage and isn't frightened.

### LORE
Some battlefields in the Border have seen so much death that the land itself became haunted. These cursed areas trap the spirits of fallen soldiers, endlessly reenacting their final battle. The only way to permanently end a haunted battlefield is to consecrate it with proper funeral rites—a dangerous undertaking.

### TACTICS
This is an environmental hazard more than a traditional enemy. DMs should:
- Describe the horror and chaos
- Track who enters the area
- Roll for spectral spawns
- Allow creative solutions (not just combat)

### CAMPAIGN USE
**Blood & Coin:** Major obstacle, quest to consecrate site  
**Shattered Oaths:** Prophecy location, must be cleansed for important ritual
