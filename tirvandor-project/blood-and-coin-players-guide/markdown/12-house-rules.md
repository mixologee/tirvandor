## SETTING INFORMATION

### THE BORDER REGION
Where You Operate:
The Border is a 50-mile-wide strip of contested land between the Thaldros Kingdom's central authority and the independent frontier territories. Neither side fully controls it, making it a haven for:
- Mercenaries (like you)
- Smugglers and traders
- Refugees from both Kingdom and frontier
- Bandits and criminals
- Independent settlements
The Conflict:
The Thaldros Kingdom wants to bring the frontier under royal control, while the frontier territories fight to remain independent. Neither can afford full-scale war, so they use mercenaries, economic pressure, and political maneuvering. The Border is where this cold war plays out.
The International Angle:
Across the Sundering Sea, the Republic of Aethoria watches this internal conflict with great interest. Some frontier leaders have ties to Aethoria and look to them as a model of independence from monarchy. Meanwhile, rising tensions between Thaldros Kingdom and Aethoria over trade routes and old grudges mean both nations may soon recruit heavily from the Border's experienced mercenaries. You're caught in the middle of both an internal and international conflict.
Major Border Towns:
- Crossroads (Population: 3,000)
- Largest Border settlement
- Iron Guild headquarters
- Neutral ground for all factions
- Your home base
- Grimwatch (Population: 800)
- Fortified trading post
- Kingdom loyalist settlement
- Good for royal military contracts
- Freehold (Population: 1,200)
- Independent village
- Sympathetic to democratic ideals (Aethoria influence)
Lots of frontier refugee work

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
Q: Can I be a good person in this campaign?
A: Yes! Many mercenaries have moral codes. You choose which contracts to take.
Q: Will we be forced to do evil things?
A: No. You can refuse any contract. But refusing loses potential income and some contracts may test your morals.
Q: Can we switch sides during a contract?
A: Technically yes, but expect severe reputation consequences. The Guild Code forbids it.
Q: What if my character wouldn't take a contract?
A: Then don't! But have an in-character reason and accept the consequences.

A: Absolutely. The Guild is neutral. Your only loyalty is to gold and the current contract.

A: Moderately lethal. Combat is dangerous but healers are available. Smart play keeps you alive.
