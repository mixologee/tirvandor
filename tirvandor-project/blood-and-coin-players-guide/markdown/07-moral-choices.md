## MORAL CHOICES & CONSEQUENCES

### THE MERCENARY'S DILEMMA
You will face hard choices:
Example Scenarios:
1. The Slaver Contract
Well-paying client wants you to recapture escaped slaves
Legal in Thaldros, profitable, but morally wrong
Refuse = lost money + possible reputation hit
Accept = good pay + moral stain
2. The Civilian Question
Contract to raid an enemy supply depot
Depot is in a civilian town
Collateral damage likely
How far do you go?
3. The Better Offer
Mid-contract, enemy offers double to switch sides
No one would know...
But your reputation...
4. The Squad vs. Contract
Contract demands you leave wounded squad mate
Saving them means failing contract
What matters more?
There Are No Perfect Answers
Every choice has consequences
Your character's values will be tested
The DM won't judge your choices
But the world will react to them
