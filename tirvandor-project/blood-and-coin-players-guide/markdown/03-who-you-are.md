## WHO YOU ARE

### THE IRON GUILD
You are members of (or affiliated with) the Iron Guild, the largest and most respected mercenary organization in the Border. The Guild operates under strict professional standards:
The Guild Code:
1. Honor Contracts – A contract, once signed, is sacred
2. No Betrayal – Never betray your squad or employer (during the contract)
3. Fair Payment – Good work deserves good pay
4. Professional Conduct – Mercenaries, not bandits
5. Reputation Matters – Your word is your bond
What This Means:
You're professionals, not murder-hobos
You can refuse any contract before signing
Once you sign, you fulfill it (or face consequences)
You can work for anyone: Thaldros, Aethoria, merchants, nobles, criminals
Your reputation affects future contracts and pay rates
