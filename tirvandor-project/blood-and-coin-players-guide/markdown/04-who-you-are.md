## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
Q: Can I be a good person in this campaign?
A: Yes! Many mercenaries have moral codes. You choose which contracts to take.

A: No. You can refuse any contract. But refusing loses potential income and some contracts may test your morals.
Q: Can we switch sides during a contract?
A: Technically yes, but expect severe reputation consequences. The Guild Code forbids it.
Q: What if my character wouldn't take a contract?
A: Then don't! But have an in-character reason and accept the consequences.

A: Moderately lethal. Combat is dangerous but healers are available. Smart play keeps you alive.
