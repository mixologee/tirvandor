## SETTING INFORMATION

### THE BORDER REGION
Where You Operate:
The Border is a 50-mile-wide strip of contested land between the Thaldros Kingdom's central authority and the independent frontier territories. Neither side fully controls it, making it a haven for:
Mercenaries (like you)
Smugglers and traders
Refugees from both Kingdom and frontier
Bandits and criminals
Independent settlements
The Conflict:
The Thaldros Kingdom wants to bring the frontier under royal control, while the frontier territories fight to remain independent. Neither can afford full-scale war, so they use mercenaries, economic pressure, and political maneuvering. The Border is where this cold war plays out.
The International Angle:
Across the Sundering Sea, the Republic of Aethoria watches this internal conflict with great interest. Some frontier leaders have ties to Aethoria and look to them as a model of independence from monarchy. Meanwhile, rising tensions between Thaldros Kingdom and Aethoria over trade routes and old grudges mean both nations may soon recruit heavily from the Border's experienced mercenaries. You're caught in the middle of both an internal and international conflict.
Major Border Towns:
Crossroads (Population: 3,000)
Largest Border settlement
Iron Guild headquarters
Neutral ground for all factions
Your home base
Grimwatch (Population: 800)
Fortified trading post
Kingdom loyalist settlement
Good for royal military contracts
Freehold (Population: 1,200)
Independent village
Sympathetic to democratic ideals (Aethoria influence)
Lots of frontier refugee work
