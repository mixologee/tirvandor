## 📖 WORLD PRIMER (Player Handout)

### Welcome to Tirvandor: The Realm of Deep Magic

**What is Tirvandor?**

Tirvandor is a world where magic flows through ancient ley lines like rivers beneath the earth, where two great continents were once joined until a catastrophic event known as the Worldrend split them apart. Three thousand years later, the kingdoms of Thaldros and Aethoria remain divided—not by distance, but by pride, philosophy, and old wounds that refuse to heal.

---

## 🗺️ THE WORLD AT A GLANCE

### Geography

**Two Continents:**
- **THALDROS (West)** - Human-dominated kingdom, military might, fortress cities
- **AETHORIA (East)** - Elven republic, magical excellence, ancient wisdom
- **THE SUNDERING SEA** - Separates the continents, dangerous waters, ruins beneath

**Key Regions:**
- **Ironspine Mountains** - Natural border, dwarf strongholds, rich mines
- **Thornwood Forest** - Ancient woods, ranger territory, druidic circles
- **Ashmar Wastes** - Volcanic badlands, fire magic, dangerous seals
- **Sundara Desert** - Oasis city-states, desert nomads, ancient mysteries

---

## ⚔️ THE POLITICAL SITUATION

**The Great Divide:**

The kingdoms were once united under a single banner. Then came the Worldrend—an arcane catastrophe that literally split the landmass in two. Each side blames the other. Each side has legitimate grievances. Both want reunification, but on their terms.

**Thaldros Kingdom** (West - Humans)
- **Ruler:** King Aldric IV Thandris
- **Philosophy:** Strength, honor, military might
- **Goal:** Reunification through power and tradition
- **Capital:** Kaer Thandros (fortress-city)

**Aethoria** (East - Elves)
- **Ruler:** High Queen Aelindra Aethermere  
- **Philosophy:** Wisdom, patience, magical knowledge
- **Goal:** Reunification through enlightenment and time
- **Capital:** Aethermere (crystalline city)

**The Tension:** A cold war of ideologies. Not open warfare, but proxy conflicts, border skirmishes, and political maneuvering. Your actions could tip the balance.
