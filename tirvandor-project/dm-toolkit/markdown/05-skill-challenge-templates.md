4. **Set DC** - Based on difficulty (Easy 10, Medium 15, Hard 20)
5. **Track Progress** - Mark successes and failures
6. **Resolve** - Overall success or failure determines outcome

**Success Threshold:**
- **Simple:** 3 successes before 3 failures
- **Moderate:** 4 successes before 3 failures
- **Complex:** 6 successes before 3 failures

**Multiple Attempts:**
