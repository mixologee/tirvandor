# The Pantheon of Tirvandor

**Divine Powers and Sacred Mysteries**

---

## Overview

The gods of Tirvandor are real, present forces that grant power to their faithful and occasionally manifest in the world. However, they are not all-knowing or all-powerful—they have limitations, conflicts, and mysteries of their own. The relationship between mortals and the divine is complex, shaped by the Divine Silence and the Worldrend, events that changed how gods and mortals interact.

**Divine Classification:**
- **The Prime Deities:** Major gods worshipped across cultures
- **The Regional Powers:** Gods prominent in specific geographic or cultural areas
- **The Ancient Primordials:** Elemental entities predating the current gods
- **The Forgotten Ones:** Deities whose worship has faded or been forbidden

**Philosophy of Worship:**
Most mortals recognize the existence of all gods but actively worship 1-3 that align with their values, profession, or circumstances. Temples often house shrines to multiple deities. Clerics typically serve one god exclusively, while paladins swear oaths to principles that may be aligned with but not bound to a single deity.

## The Prime Deities

These gods are widely worshipped across both continents, though interpretations of their nature may vary between cultures.

### Aethros, The Lightbringer

**Domain:** Sun, Truth, Justice, Healing
**Symbol:** Golden sun with seven rays
**Alignment:** Lawful Good
**Sacred Day:** Summer Solstice
**Clergy:** Sunguard (paladins), Lightbearers (clerics)

Aethros represents the ideal of lawful righteousness. His followers believe truth and justice will triumph over lies and tyranny. During the Divine Silence, Aethros was the first god to return, earning him great devotion but also questions about where he had been.

**Teachings:**
- Truth spoken aloud has power over lies
- Justice must be tempered with mercy
- Protect the innocent and weak
- Light drives away darkness, literally and metaphorically

**Worship:** Grand temples with open roofs to let in sunlight, services at dawn, healing of the sick as holy duty

**Following:** Strong in cities with established legal systems, among paladins, healers, and those seeking justice. Primary deity in Silverpine and Kaer Thandros.

### Nythara, The Moonwatcher

**Domain:** Moon, Secrets, Travel, Prophecy
**Symbol:** Crescent moon with a single star
**Alignment:** Neutral Good
**Sacred Day:** New Moon
**Clergy:** Moon Seers (clerics), Star Readers (diviners)

Nythara is the keeper of secrets and the patron of those who travel in darkness—both literal night travelers and those who walk hidden paths. She knows what others hide and sees what is yet to come, though her prophecies are notoriously cryptic.

**Teachings:**
- Not all truths are meant to be revealed
- The path forward is shown to those who watch patiently
- Protect travelers, especially in darkness
- Mystery has its place in the world

**Worship:** Temples open to the night sky, services under the new moon, pilgrimages between sacred sites

**Following:** Common among travelers, rogues, diviners, and those seeking hidden knowledge. Particularly strong in Starfall and port cities.

### Gorath, The Forgemaster

**Domain:** Crafting, Mountains, Law, Protection
**Symbol:** Anvil with crossed hammers
**Alignment:** Lawful Neutral
**Sacred Day:** Midwinter (when the forge is most important for survival)
**Clergy:** Forgewardens (clerics), Runepriests (specialized clergy)

Gorath teaches that through skill, patience, and hard work, mortals can create things of lasting value. He is the god of dwarves first and foremost, but any craftsman may honor him. He values contracts, oaths, and the rule of law.

**Teachings:**
- Quality work honors the divine
- An oath once given is sacred
- Protect what you have built
- Progress comes through mastery of craft

**Worship:** Underground temples near forges, blessings of new works, apprenticeship ceremonies

**Following:** Dominant among dwarves, strong among blacksmiths, masons, and craftspeople of all races. Ironhold is effectively a theocracy of Gorath.

---

### Sylvara, The Wildmother

**Domain:** Nature, Growth, Weather, Beasts
**Symbol:** Oak tree with roots and branches intertwined
**Alignment:** Neutral
**Sacred Day:** Spring Equinox
**Clergy:** Druids (her primary servants), Nature Clerics

Sylvara embodies the natural world in all its beauty and brutality. She represents the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. Her worship predates many of the other gods, with some believing she is actually a mortal's understanding of a primal force rather than a traditional deity.

**Teachings:**
- Nature must maintain balance
- Death feeds life, life returns to death
- Civilization and wilderness can coexist with respect
- The strong survive, but the strong also protect the future

**Worship:** Sacred groves, stone circles, open-air ceremonies, animal sacrifices (returned to the wild), seasonal festivals

**Following:** Dominant in Aethoria, especially the Emerald Depths and Wildgrove. Druids of Sylvara form powerful councils in eastern politics.

---

### Mortas, The Silent Judge

**Domain:** Death, Transition, Judgment, Memory
**Symbol:** Balanced scales with a raven perched atop
**Alignment:** Lawful Neutral
**Sacred Day:** Autumn Equinox (when the world dies back)
**Clergy:** Death Speakers (clerics), Grave Wardens (paladins who destroy undead)

Mortas guides souls to their proper afterlife and judges the dead. He is not evil—he is necessary. His clergy comfort the bereaved, conduct funerals, and most importantly, prevent and destroy undeath, which they consider the greatest blasphemy.

**Teachings:**
- Death is natural and not to be feared
- The dead must be honored but allowed to rest
- Undeath is a perversion of the natural order
- Everyone faces the Silent Judge eventually

**Worship:** Austere temples near graveyards, memorial services, cremation or ritual burial

**Following:** Every culture acknowledges Mortas, though some with more fear than others. His clergy are respected everywhere. Major temples in all large cities.

---

### Veyrith, The Merchant Prince

**Domain:** Commerce, Travel, Communication, Cunning
**Symbol:** Gold coin showing a road on one side, a ship on the other
**Alignment:** Neutral
**Sacred Day:** First day of Spring (beginning of trade season)
**Clergy:** Coin Priests (clerics), Trade Factors (business-focused worshippers)

Veyrith teaches that commerce brings prosperity and that prosperity brings peace. He is the god of merchants, traders, and anyone making a deal. He values cunning and success, but deals made under his auspices are binding—breaking a Veyrith-sworn contract brings his curse.

**Teachings:**
- Prosperity is virtue
- An honest deal benefits all parties
- Communication binds people across distances
- Cleverness is rewarded, stupidity punished

**Worship:** Temples that double as trading halls, blessing of caravans, contract witnessing

**Following:** Universal in cities, especially trading hubs like Port Myrthen, Goldreach, and Crystalbrook. Merchants' guilds are often also religious organizations.

---

### Kalythra, The Stormmother

**Domain:** Sea, Storms, Chaos, Freedom
**Symbol:** Crashing wave with lightning bolt
**Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral
**Sacred Day:** Unpredictable—when major storms occur
**Clergy:** Storm Callers (clerics), Tide Readers (sailors who can predict weather)

Kalythra embodies the raw power and unpredictability of the ocean and storms. She is neither good nor evil—she simply is, like the weather itself. Sailors pray to her for safe passage and fear her wrath. Her moods are as changeable as the sea.

**Teachings:**
- Freedom is more valuable than safety
- Respect the power of nature
- Adapt or be destroyed
- The storm passes, but the sea remains

**Worship:** Coastal shrines, ship blessings, offerings thrown into the sea, storm dances

**Following:** Dominant in coastal communities and among sailors. Major temples in Goldreach, Marshaven, and all port cities. Feared as much as worshipped.

---

### Zarathos, The Archmage

**Domain:** Magic, Knowledge, Innovation, Ambition
**Symbol:** Spiral of seven colors (the magical spectrum)
**Alignment:** Neutral
**Sacred Day:** Night of the Seven Stars (a rare celestial alignment)
**Clergy:** Lorekeepers (clerics), Arcane Apostles (wizard-priests)

Zarathos is the youngest of the Prime Deities, having ascended from mortal wizard to divinity during the Age of Dawn. He teaches that through magical knowledge, mortals can transcend their limitations. His worship is controversial—some see him as inspiration, others as a dangerous example of hubris.

**Teachings:**
- Magic is the path to understanding reality
- Knowledge should be sought, preserved, and advanced
- Ambition drives progress
- The unknown should be studied, not feared

**Worship:** Libraries converted to temples, universities, magical academies, ceremonies during meteor showers

**Following:** Strong among wizards and scholars. Major temples in Silverpine, Aethermere, and Starfall. Controversial among more conservative faiths.

## The Ancient Primordials

These are not gods in the traditional sense but elemental forces that predate the current pantheon. They are not worshipped through temples but through primal magic and druidic rites.

**Ignar, the First Flame**
- Element: Fire
- Nature: Creation and destruction through flame
- Current State: Sleeping beneath volcanic regions

**Thalassia, the Endless Depth**

- Current State: Lurking in shadows, neither good nor evil

Druids and some primal magic users draw power directly from these Primordials rather than from the gods. The relationship between Primordials and gods is unclear—some scholars believe the gods emerged from the Primordials, others that they coexist in different ways.

## Religious Structures and Orders

### The Celestial Council

A gathering of high priests from the Prime Deities that meets every seven years to discuss matters affecting all faiths. Established 400 CR, it has no enforcement power but significant moral authority.

### The Order of the Threefold Path

Paladins and clerics who serve Aethros, Nythara, and Mortas together, believing these three form a complete cycle of light, shadow, and ending. Elite monster hunters and protectors of the innocent.

### The Green Faith

A druidic organization spanning both continents, dedicated to Sylvara and the Primordials. They maintain the sacred groves and regulate who may learn primal magic.

### The Academies of Zarathos

Institutions of magical learning that combine religious devotion with arcane study. They sometimes clash with traditional religious authorities over the role of magic in society.

### Independent Temples

Many temples operate independently, focused on serving their community rather than broader religious politics. These are most common in small towns and villages.

## The Divine Silence: Lasting Effects

The period when the gods stopped answering prayers (2,400-2,200 BS) fundamentally changed divine-mortal relationships:

**Trust Issues:** Some mortals never fully trusted the gods again. When asked where they were, the gods provided no clear answer.

**Rise of Arcane Magic:** When divine magic failed, arcane magic filled the void. The relationship was never the same.

**New Covenants:** When the gods returned, they established new terms for granting power. Clerics must be more devout, paladins more committed to their oaths.

**The Unanswered Questions:** Where did the gods go? Why did they return? Are they as powerful as they claim? These questions haunt theological scholars.

**Diverse Interpretations:** Different faiths explain the Silence differently, leading to theological disputes.

---

## Divine Magic in Practice

**Clerics:** Granted power directly from their deity. Must pray daily, follow tenets, and advance their god's interests. Lose powers if they violate their divine code.

**Paladins:** Swear oaths (Devotion, Ancients, Vengeance, etc.) that align with divine principles but are personal commitments. Their power comes from the strength of their conviction as much as from any deity.

**Divine Soul Sorcerers:** Born with a connection to divine energy, often seen as chosen or blessed. They don't pray for power—it's innate.

**Celestial Warlocks:** Those who make pacts with celestial beings (angels, archons, etc.). Their relationship with divinity is transactional rather than devotional.

---

## Faith and Culture

**Thaldros:** More organized religion, structured hierarchies, written scriptures. Faith is public and communal.

**Aethoria:** More mystical and personal approaches, oral traditions, druids as spiritual guides. Faith is often private and experiential.

**The Islands:** Syncretic practices blending eastern and western traditions. Practical faith focused on immediate needs.

**Philosophical Differences:** Does divine power prove divine wisdom? Should mortals obey gods or simply acknowledge them? Is worship transactional or devotional? These debates continue.

---

## Interaction with Other Planes

The gods reside in the **Celestial Realms**—planes of existence adjacent to the material world. However, they are not the only powers:

**Archfey:** Powerful entities of the Feywild, neither gods nor mortals
**Demon Princes:** Evil beings of the Abyss who offer power to warlocks
**Devil Archdukes:** Lawful evil entities of the Nine Hells
**Primordial Aspects:** Elemental entities from elemental planes
**Great Old Ones:** Alien consciousnesses beyond mortal understanding

Some mortals worship or serve these beings instead of or in addition to the gods, making Tirvandor's religious landscape complex and sometimes dangerous.

---

*The gods of Tirvandor are real but not omnipotent. They have agendas, make mistakes, and compete with each other—sometimes subtly, sometimes openly. Mortals must navigate these divine politics while maintaining their own agency and pursuing their own goals.*
