# THALDROS MILITARY

**10 Soldiers, Agents, and War Machines of the Empire**

*The disciplined might of Thaldros, from conscripts to champions*

---

## 1. THALDROS CONSCRIPT

*Medium humanoid (any race), lawful neutral*

**Armor Class** 10 (no armor)  
**Hit Points** 4 (1d8)  
**Speed** 30 ft.

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 10 (+0) | 10 (+0) | 10 (+0) | 9 (-1) | 10 (+0) | 9 (-1) |

**Senses** passive Perception 10  
**Languages** Common  
**Challenge** 1/8 (25 XP)

**Poorly Trained.** The conscript has disadvantage on attack rolls if an ally within 5 feet is reduced to 0 hit points since the end of the conscript's last turn.

**Reluctant Fighter.** The conscript has disadvantage on death saving throws.

### ACTIONS

**Spear.** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +2 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 3 (1d6) piercing damage, or 4 (1d8) piercing damage if used with two hands for a melee attack.

### LORE
Most of Thaldros's army consists of conscripted farmers, laborers, and urban poor. They're given minimal training and thrown into battle. Many desert if given the chance. Conscripts often have families back home they're fighting to return to.

### TACTICS
- Fight in large groups (5-20)
- Flee if leaders fall
- May surrender if treated well
- Protect each other (poorly)

### CAMPAIGN USE
**Blood & Coin:** Moral question—they're enemies but also victims  
**Shattered Oaths:** Perfect target for compassion/recruitment

## 2. THALDROS SOLDIER

*Medium humanoid (any race), lawful neutral*

**Armor Class** 16 (chain shirt, shield)  
**Hit Points** 11 (2d8 + 2)  
**Speed** 30 ft.

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |

**Senses** passive Perception 12  
**Languages** Common  
**Challenge** 1/2 (100 XP)

**Formation Fighter.** The soldier has advantage on saving throws against being frightened while within 5 feet of an ally.

**Imperial Discipline.** The soldier can reroll a failed saving throw once per short rest.

### ACTIONS

**Longsword.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d8 + 1) slashing damage, or 6 (1d10 + 1) slashing damage if used with two hands.

**Crossbow.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d8 + 1) piercing damage.

### REACTIONS

**Shield Wall.** When an ally within 5 feet is hit by an attack, the soldier can grant them +2 to AC against that attack.

### LORE
Professional soldiers of Thaldros are disciplined, well-equipped, and indoctrinated into loyalty to the empire. Unlike conscripts, they're career soldiers who believe in Thaldros's vision of order and stability.

### TACTICS
- Fight in formation (shield wall)
- Support allies
- Follow orders strictly
- Retreat only when commanded

### CAMPAIGN USE
**Both:** Standard enemy troops, garrison guards, patrol units

---

## 3. IRON LEGION ENFORCER

*Medium humanoid (any race), lawful evil*

**Armor Class** 13 (leather armor)  
**Hit Points** 32 (5d8 + 10)  
**Speed** 30 ft.

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |

**Brutal.** The enforcer's melee weapon attacks deal one extra die of damage (included in the attacks).

**Pack Tactics.** The enforcer has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the enforcer's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

### ACTIONS

**Multiattack.** The enforcer makes two attacks with its mace.

**Mace.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage.

**Intimidate.** The enforcer targets one creature it can see within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

### LORE
The Iron Legion are Thaldros's internal security force—brutal enforcers who maintain order through fear and violence. They're called when the regular army isn't cruel enough. Hated by commoners and feared even by soldiers.

### TACTICS
- Use intimidation liberally
- Beat down resisters
- Work in pairs or groups
- Make examples of defiers

### CAMPAIGN USE
**Blood & Coin:** May hire mercenaries for dirty work  
**Shattered Oaths:** Perfect villains—cruel oppressors

## 4. ROYAL GUARD ELITE

*Medium humanoid (any race), lawful neutral*

**Armor Class** 18 (plate armor)  
**Hit Points** 52 (8d8 + 16)  
**Speed** 30 ft.

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |

**Heavy Crossbow.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +2 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d10) piercing damage.

**Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** For 1 minute, the guard can utter a command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature within 30 feet makes an attack roll or saving throw. That creature can add a d4 to its roll. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time.

### REACTIONS

**Parry.** The guard adds 2 to their AC against one melee attack that would hit them.

### LORE
The Royal Guard are the elite soldiers of Thaldros, sworn to protect nobility and enforce the king's will. They're highly trained, well-equipped, and fanatically loyal. Unlike Iron Legion thugs, Royal Guards are respected even by their enemies.

### TACTICS
- Protect VIPs at all costs
- Use Leadership to buff allies
- Fight honorably but effectively
- Coordinate attacks

### CAMPAIGN USE
**Both:** Bodyguards for important targets, elite enemies, potential honorable foes

## 5. STATE INQUISITOR

*Medium humanoid (any race), lawful evil*

**Hit Points** 78 (12d8 + 24)  
**Speed** 30 ft.

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 11 (+0) | 16 (+3) | 14 (+2) | 16 (+3) | 14 (+2) | 16 (+3) |

**Senses** passive Perception 15  
**Languages** Common, plus three others  
**Challenge** 6 (2,300 XP)

**Cunning Action.** On each turn, the inquisitor can use a bonus action to Dash, Disengage, or Hide.

**Evasion.** If the inquisitor is subjected to an effect that allows them to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, they take no damage on a success and half damage on a failure.

**Sneak Attack (1/Turn).** The inquisitor deals an extra 14 (4d6) damage when hitting with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally.

**Information Network.** The inquisitor can spend 1 hour in a settlement to learn one piece of useful information about a specific person or event.

### ACTIONS

**Multiattack.** The inquisitor makes two shortsword attacks.

**Shortsword.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, plus poison (see Poisoned Blade).

**Hand Crossbow.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, plus poison (see Poisoned Blade).

**Poisoned Blade.** The inquisitor's weapon is coated in a special poison. The target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.

**Interrogate (3/Day).** The inquisitor targets one creature within 30 feet that can hear them. The target must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target is compelled to answer one question truthfully. This is a magical compulsion effect.

### REACTIONS

**Uncanny Dodge.** When an attacker the inquisitor can see hits them with an attack, they can halve the attack's damage.

### LORE
State Inquisitors are Thaldros's secret police—spies, assassins, and interrogators who root out dissent and eliminate threats to the empire. They're feared throughout Tirvandor and operate with complete authority.

### TACTICS
- Gather intelligence first
- Poisoned weapons on priority targets
- Use Interrogate to extract info
- Escape if discovered

### CAMPAIGN USE
**Blood & Coin:** Quest givers (if players work for Thaldros) or dangerous enemies  
**Shattered Oaths:** Major antagonists, hunter of heroes

## 6. WAR MAGE OF THALDROS

*Medium humanoid (any race), lawful neutral*

**Armor Class** 12 (15 with *mage armor*)  
**Hit Points** 66 (12d8 + 12)  
**Speed** 30 ft.

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 9 (-1) | 14 (+2) | 12 (+1) | 17 (+3) | 12 (+1) | 11 (+0) |

**Saving Throws** Intelligence +6, Wisdom +4  
**Skills** Arcana +6, History +6  
**Senses** passive Perception 11  
**Languages** Common, plus three others  
**Challenge** 7 (2,900 XP)

**Spellcasting.** The mage is a 9th-level spellcaster. Spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). The mage has the following wizard spells prepared:

Cantrips: *fire bolt, light, mage hand, prestidigitation*  
1st level (4 slots): *detect magic, mage armor, magic missile, shield*  
2nd level (3 slots): *misty step, scorching ray, suggestion*

4th level (3 slots): *greater invisibility, ice storm*  
5th level (1 slot): *cone of cold, wall of force*

**War Caster.** The mage has advantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on spells. When a hostile creature's movement provokes an opportunity attack, the mage can cast a spell at the creature rather than making an opportunity attack.

### ACTIONS

**Quarterstaff.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 2 (1d6 - 1) bludgeoning damage, or 3 (1d8 - 1) if used with two hands.

### LORE
Thaldros trains battle mages specifically for military operations. Unlike academic wizards, War Mages focus on destructive evocation magic and battlefield control. They're attached to military units and respected (and feared) by soldiers.

### TACTICS
- Stay behind front line
- Use *fireball* and *lightning bolt* on groups
- *Counterspell* enemy magic
- *Misty step* away from danger
- Conserve 5th level slot for emergency

**Magic Resistance.** The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Siege Monster.** The golem deals double damage to objects and structures.

**Siege Mode (1/Day).** For 1 minute, the golem becomes rooted in place (speed 0) but gains advantage on attack rolls and its attacks deal maximum damage to structures.

### LORE
Thaldros's military mages have created these massive constructs for sieges and large battles. They're slow but nearly unstoppable, designed to break through fortifications and scatter enemy formations.

### TACTICS
- Advance slowly and steadily
- Focus on structures in Siege Mode
- Target clustered enemies with Boulder Launch
- Ignore distractions

### CAMPAIGN USE
**Both:** Major set-piece battle, siege defense/assault

| 20 (+5) | 15 (+2) | 14 (+2) | 10 (+0) | 14 (+2) | 12 (+1) |

**Saving Throws** Strength +9, Constitution +6  
**Skills** Athletics +9, Intimidation +5, Perception +6

### REACTIONS

**Parry.** The champion adds 4 to their AC against one melee attack that would hit them.

### LORE
Thaldros generals sometimes send their personal champions to deal with important threats or lead special missions. These warriors are the best of the best—veterans of countless battles, master tacticians, and nearly unbeatable in single combat.

### TACTICS
- Challenge the strongest enemy
- Use Rally to support troops
- Fight honorably but ruthlessly
- Never surrender

### CAMPAIGN USE
**Both:** Mini-boss, duel challenge, enemy leader

## 9. IRON CROWN KNIGHT

*Medium humanoid (any race), lawful evil*

**Armor Class** 20 (plate armor +2, shield)  
**Hit Points** 153 (18d8 + 72)  
**Speed** 30 ft.

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |

**Condition Immunities** frightened

**Channel Divinity: Iron Command (1/Day).** Each hostile creature within 30 feet must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature is paralyzed until the end of the knight's next turn.

### REACTIONS

**Oath of Protection.** When a creature within 5 feet is hit by an attack, the knight can make that attack target them instead.

### LORE
The Iron Crown Knights are Thaldros's holy warriors, fanatically devoted to the concept of ordered civilization through strength. They're paladins who've sworn the Oath of the Iron Crown and serve as both warriors and enforcers of imperial law.

### TACTICS
- Use Aura of Tyranny to buff allies
- Command the battlefield
- Iron Command at start of combat
- Protect important allies

### CAMPAIGN USE
**Shattered Oaths:** Major villain, recurring antagonist, final arc enemy

**Armor Class** 21 (plate armor +3, shield +1)  
**Hit Points** 187 (22d8 + 88)  
**Speed** 30 ft.

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 20 (+5) | 14 (+2) | 18 (+4) | 16 (+3) | 16 (+3) | 18 (+4) |

**Saving Throws** Strength +10, Constitution +9, Wisdom +8, Charisma +9  
**Skills** Athletics +10, History +8, Insight +8, Intimidation +9, Perception +8  
**Damage Resistances** all damage from spells  
**Condition Immunities** frightened  
**Senses** passive Perception 18  
**Languages** Common, plus four others  
**Challenge** 13 (10,000 XP)

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Varius fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Supreme Commander.** Allied creatures within 60 feet have advantage on saving throws against being frightened and add 1d6 to damage rolls.

**Tactical Genius.** Varius can take a special reaction at initiative count 20 (losing ties) to command an ally within 60 feet to immediately take an action.

**Magic Resistance.** Varius has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### ACTIONS

**Multiattack.** Varius makes three longsword attacks.

**Longsword of Command +3.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (1d8 + 8) slashing damage, or 13 (1d10 + 8) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 9 (2d8) radiant damage.

**Tactical Reposition (Costs 3 Actions).** Varius and up to four allies within 60 feet can move up to their speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

### LORE
Lord Commander Varius is Thaldros's supreme military leader—a brilliant tactician, legendary warrior, and unshakeable loyalist. He's not evil, but he genuinely believes in Thaldros's vision of ordered civilization. Many soldiers would die for him, and even his enemies respect him.

In **Blood & Coin**, he may hire the party for missions or become an honorable foe.  
In **Shattered Oaths**, he's a major antagonist—the final military obstacle before the true villain.

### TACTICS
- Command the battlefield
- Use Tactical Genius and Legendary Actions to control action economy
- Rally troops when needed
- Lead from the front but strategically
- Respect worthy opponents

### CAMPAIGN USE
**Both:** Major boss fight, final act antagonist, recurring enemy leader

**END OF THALDROS MILITARY**

*10 enemy types from conscripts to commanders*

**Next: Aethoria Resistance fighters...*
