# Blood & Coin: Act I - Blood for Coin
## The Morally Grey Campaign - Levels 1-5

**Campaign:** Blood & Coin  
**Act:** I - Blood for Coin  
**Level Range:** 1-5  
**Duration:** 15-20 sessions  
**Tone:** Gritty, morally grey, mercenary survival  
**Theme:** "Everyone's got to start somewhere"

---

## Act I Overview

### **The Premise**

You're not heroes. You're professionals. Sellswords. Problem-solvers for hire. You've come to **Crossroads**, a lawless mercenary town in the frontier regions of Thaldros, where the Crown's authority barely reaches, where the only laws are:

1. **Contracts are sacred** - Break your word, die
2. **Don't kill clients before they pay** - Bad for business
3. **Survive first, moralize later** - Idealism gets you killed

Welcome to the profession. You'll learn quickly that every job has a catch, every client lies, and coin is the only thing you can trust—until you can't.

### **What Act I Teaches**

By the end of Act I, players will understand:
- There are no clear good guys or bad guys
- Every choice has consequences
- Money matters, survival matters more
- Reputation opens doors (and closes them)
- You can't please everyone
- Sometimes the "right" choice gets you killed

### **Starting Setup**

**Location:** Crossroads (pop. 2,400) - neutral mercenary town  
**Starting Level:** 1  
**Starting Gold:** 50gp each (more than standard - you're professionals)  
**PC Backgrounds:** All should have reason to be mercenaries (exiled, desperate, pragmatic, etc.)

## Crossroads - The Mercenary Town

### **Overview**

Crossroads sits at the intersection of three trade routes, far from royal oversight. No official government—the **Iron Guild** runs things through contracts and reputation. Violence is common but regulated. Murder is allowed if you have a contract. Theft is punishable by death (bad for business). Lying is expected, getting caught is fatal.

**Population:** ~2,400 (fluctuates with seasonal campaigns)  
**Demographics:** 60% human, 15% dwarf, 10% half-orc, 10% halfling, 5% other  
**Government:** Iron Guild (mercenary guild)  
**Economy:** Mercenary work, black market, vice  
**Alignment:** True Neutral (officially), Chaotic Neutral (practically)

### **Key Locations**

**1. The Iron Guild Hall**
- Three-story stone building, fortified
- Contract Board (public jobs)
- Varak's Office (private contracts)
- Meeting rooms, barracks for members
- Training yard

**2. The Copper Dragon Inn**
- Largest inn/tavern in town
- Run by Mira Copperstone (information broker)
- 20 rooms (5sp-5gp/night)
- Common room always busy
- Best place for rumors

**3. The Grey Market**
- Open-air black market
- Anything can be bought/sold (no questions)
- Weapons, armor, poisons, information
- Fences operate openly here

**4. The Pit**
- Fighting arena
- Legal blood sport
- Betting, recruiting, entertainment
- Reputation-building opportunity

**5. Temple of the Coin**
- Ironic "temple" to wealth
- Actually just gambling hall
- Loan sharks operate from back rooms
- Some healing available (expensive)

### **Factions in Crossroads**

- Dues: 15% but higher-paying contracts
- Benefits: Better pay, fewer rules, more dangerous

**The Grey Merchants** (Economic)
- Leader: Various merchants, no central authority
- Philosophy: Profit above all

## 🎯 Quest 1.1: Welcome to Crossroads

**Level:** 1  
**Duration:** 1-2 sessions  
**Objective:** Complete first contract, gain Iron Guild membership  
**Key NPCs:** Varak Ironhand, "Lucky" Finn, Mira Copperstone  
**Rewards:** 50-75gp, Iron Guild membership (if accepted)

### **Opening - Arrival at Crossroads**

Each PC arrives at Crossroads for their own reasons. Run individual cold opens for each PC (5-10 minutes each) showing why they're here:

**Example Hooks:**

**The Exiled Noble:**
> *The carriage dumped you at the crossroads at dawn. Your family's signet ring—the last tie to your old life—weighs heavy in your pocket. The magistrate's words echo: "Leave the kingdom or hang for treason." You chose exile. Now you need gold to survive, and pride won't feed you.*

**The Desperate Debtor:**
> *Three months. That's how long until Vareth the loan shark sends his collectors. You owe 500 gold—might as well be 5,000. The only place that pays enough is Crossroads. Dangerous work, but dying in combat beats dying in a gutter with your kneecaps shattered.*

**The Pragmatic Sellsword:**
> *You've been a soldier for ten years. Fought for three different armies. Watched nobles send peasants to die for "glory." You learned one thing: loyalty doesn't pay bills. Gold does. Crossroads is where professionals go when they're done pretending to be heroes.*

**The Outcast:**
> *Your village cast you out for your "gift"—the magic in your blood. They called you cursed, dangerous, unnatural. Fine. Let them fear you. Crossroads doesn't care what you are, only what you can do. Time to make them regret exiling someone useful.*

### **Scene 1: The COPPER DRAGON**

After individual intros, PCs all end up at **The Copper Dragon** inn. This is where the campaign truly begins.

**Read Aloud:**

> *The Copper Dragon's common room reeks of smoke, sweat, and spilled ale. Two dozen mercenaries drink, gamble, and trade war stories. Most are armed—swords, axes, bows propped casually against tables. A few glance at you, assess you as threat or opportunity, then return to their drinks.*
>
> *Behind the bar, a middle-aged halfling woman polishes a glass that will never be clean. Her eyes are sharp, calculating. She's seen a thousand sellswords walk through that door. She's wondering if you'll walk out.*
>
> *A dwarf in battered plate armor sits alone in the corner, nursing an ale. His beard is iron-grey, his hands scarred. A veteran. He watches you with interest.*

**NPCs Present:**

**Mira Copperstone** (Halfling, Neutral, Commoner)
- **Role:** Innkeeper and information broker
- **Appearance:** 40s, practical clothes, sharp eyes, friendly smile that doesn't reach her eyes
- **Personality:** Friendly but mercenary, knows everything, sells information
- **Dialogue:** *"New faces! Welcome to the Dragon. Rooms are 5 silver, meals are 1 silver, information is negotiable. What can I get you?"*

**"Lucky" Finn** (Human, Neutral Good, Veteran)
- **Role:** Retired mercenary, mentor figure, Iron Guild recruiter
- **Appearance:** 50s, eye patch, scarred face, still strong despite age
- **Personality:** Gruff but kind, wants to help new blood survive
- **Dialogue:** *"You lot look fresh. Too clean. The Crossroads will fix that. Sit down. Let me tell you how not to die."*

### **Interaction: Lucky Finn's Advice**

If PCs engage with Finn, he offers free advice (he's genuinely trying to help):

**Finn's Wisdom:**

*"Listen up. You want to survive Crossroads? Three rules:*

*One: Join the Iron Guild. Pay the dues, follow the contracts, and you get protection. Work outside the guild, you're on your own. Someone kills you over a disagreement? Nobody cares.*

*Two: Never break a contract. Ever. I don't care if the client lied, if you learned something new, if you had a moral revelation—you finish the job or you die. Reputation is everything here.*

*Three: Don't trust anyone. Not me, not Mira, not your drinking buddies, not your partners. Everyone's got an angle. Gold talks, friendship walks.*

*Follow those rules, you might last a month. Break them, you'll be dead in a week."*

**If PCs ask about work:**

*"Go see Varak at the Iron Guild Hall. He's got the Contract Board—public jobs for new blood. Prove yourself, he'll offer membership. First month's dues waived if you're good enough. Get you access to better contracts, better pay, better protection."*

**If PCs ask about Varak:**

*"Dwarf. Old school. Honorable to a fault, which is a weakness in this business. But he runs a tight guild. Pay your dues, follow the contracts, he'll back you. Break the rules? He'll kill you himself. Respect that."*

### **Scene 2: The IRON GUILD HALL**

PCs make their way to the Iron Guild Hall to find work.

**Read Aloud:**

> *The Iron Guild Hall dominates the town square—three stories of dark stone, built like a fortress. Two mercenaries flank the entrance, arms crossed, weapons visible. They size you up as you approach. One nods. You're allowed to enter.*
>
> *Inside, the hall is all business. The main room is a mix of meeting hall and armory. A dozen mercenaries cluster around a large wooden board covered in parchment—contracts, each sealed with wax. Arguments break out over who gets which job.*
>
> *Behind a heavy oak desk sits a dwarf in well-maintained chainmail. His beard is braided with iron rings. His eyes are hard, calculating, measuring. He doesn't smile.*

**NPC: Varak Ironhand**

*Medium humanoid (dwarf), lawful neutral*

**Appearance:** 180 years old (middle-aged for a dwarf), grey-streaked brown beard in tight braids, iron rings woven throughout, chainmail always worn, massive warhammer propped against desk, scarred hands

**Personality:**
- Gruff, no-nonsense, business-first
- Values honor (in contracts, not morality)
- Respects competence, despises incompetence
- Protective of guild members (they're assets)
- Zero tolerance for contract-breakers

**Stats:** Use **Veteran** stats (CR 3), but won't fight unless absolutely necessary

**Voice & Mannerisms:**
- Speaks bluntly, wastes no words
- Taps desk with iron ring when thinking
- Makes eye contact, holds it uncomfortably long
- Quotes prices and terms immediately

### **Interaction: Varak's Offer**

**Read Aloud (Varak Speaks):**

> *"New blood. I can smell the desperation from here. Let me guess—you need gold, you're willing to kill for it, and you think that makes you special. It doesn't. There's a hundred sellswords in this town with the same story."*
>
> *He leans forward, iron rings in his beard clinking.*
>
> *"But I need bodies. The guild is expanding, and most of these idiots die before they're useful. So here's my offer: Complete one contract. Any contract from the board. Bring proof of completion. If you survive and don't screw it up, I'll offer Iron Guild membership. First month's dues waived. After that, 10% of your earnings."*
>
> *He sits back.*
>
> *"Questions?"*

**If PCs ask about membership benefits:**

*"Protection. You wear the guild mark, other mercenaries know you're backed. Kill a guild member without a contract, the guild kills you. Simple. You also get access to the barracks, better contracts, and my network. I know who's hiring, who's reliable, who's a backstabbing bastard. That information keeps you alive."*

**If PCs ask about the contracts:**

*"Three on the board right now. All entry-level. Pick one, complete it, come back. You can work alone or in a group—I don't care, as long as the job's done. Read the contracts carefully. Clients lie. Part of the business."*

**If PCs ask if they can negotiate:**

*"With me? No. With the client? That's your business. Just remember—once you take a contract, you complete it. Break your word, the guild hunts you. We have a reputation to maintain."*

### **The Contract Board**

Three contracts are available. PCs must choose ONE (or work together on one).

**Option A: Rat Problem** (Straightforward... at first)
- **Client:** Merchant Oleg Tharn
- **Target:** Clear giant rats from warehouse
- **Payment:** 50gp
- **Details:** "Rats infesting my warehouse. Killing my profits. Kill them all. Bring me a dozen rat tails as proof."
- **Fine Print:** None listed
- **Truth:** Rats are protecting stolen goods the merchant fenced. Returning goods to rightful owner = 75gp reward + enemy. Keeping quiet = 50gp + dirty conscience.

**Option B: Debt Collection** (Morally uncomfortable)
- **Client:** Loan shark Vareth Goldtooth
- **Target:** Collect 100gp debt from "Thomas Redhill"
- **Payment:** 75gp
- **Details:** "Thomas owes me 100 gold. Three months overdue. Collect by any means necessary. Broken bones acceptable. Death is not—dead men don't pay."
- **Fine Print:** "10gp bonus if you make an example of him (public beating)"
- **Truth:** Thomas is a widower with a sick child. Used loan for medicine. Child recovered but Thomas lost job. He's desperate, not malicious.

**Option C: Caravan Guard** (Hidden complications)
- **Client:** Merchant Cassia Valen
- **Target:** Escort cargo wagon to next town (20 miles)
- **Payment:** 60gp total (split among party)
- **Details:** "Simple escort duty. Leave at dawn, arrive by dusk. Standard bandit territory. Nothing special."
- **Fine Print:** "Contents of cargo not your concern"
- **Truth:** Cargo is smuggled narcotics. Bandits are actually law enforcement trying to intercept shipment. Help smuggler = profit but criminal. Help law = reputation damage with merchants.

**DM NOTE:** Let PCs read all three contracts. They can discuss, debate, and choose based on their characters' motivations. This choice reveals their priorities: profit (highest pay), morality (least harmful), or pragmatism (easiest job).

### **Quest 1.1A: Rat Problem**

**If PCs choose this contract:**

**Client Meeting:** Merchant Oleg Tharn

**Read Aloud:**

> *Oleg Tharn's warehouse sits on the edge of town, a squat wooden building with a sagging roof. The merchant himself is rotund, sweating despite the cool morning. His smile is too wide, his eyes too shifty. He keeps glancing at the warehouse nervously.*
>
> *"Ah, excellent! The guild sent help! Yes, yes, terrible rat problem. Vicious creatures. Killed my warehouse boy last week—terrible accident. Just go in there, kill them all, bring me proof. Dozen tails should do. I'll have your gold ready. Simple job!"*

**Insight DC 12:** Oleg is lying about something. He's more worried about what's IN the warehouse than the rats.

**Perception DC 13:** There's no damage to the warehouse consistent with rat infestation (no gnawed wood, no droppings near entrance).

**If PCs ask questions:**

**"What kind of cargo?":** *"Dry goods, cloth, nothing valuable! That's why I can't afford to lose it to rats!"*  
**"Why not hire an exterminator?":** *"Tried! Three exterminators quit after one look. Said the rats were too aggressive. That's why I need armed professionals!"*  
**"Can we see inside first?":** *"No, no! Too dangerous! The boy died, remember? Just go in, kill them, come out. I'll wait here. Very far away. Outside."*

**the warehouse**

**Read Aloud:**

> *The warehouse door creaks open. The stench hits you first—rot, mold, and something metallic. Blood. Your eyes adjust to the darkness. The interior is a maze of crates and barrels. Scratching sounds echo from deeper within. Something moves in the shadows. Multiple somethings.*

**Encounter:** 8 **Giant Rats** (CR 1/8 each)

**Tactics:**
- Rats attack in groups of 2-3
- Use Pack Tactics (advantage when ally is within 5 ft)
- Flee if more than 5 are killed
- Not defending territory—defending something specific

**the discovery**

Once rats are cleared (killed or driven off), PCs can investigate:

**Perception DC 14:** One section of floor is newer than the rest—recently replaced boards.

**Investigation DC 12:** Prying up boards reveals hidden cache underneath:
- **10 bolts of fine silk** (worth 50gp each, 500gp total)
- **Merchant's ledger** (shows silk stolen from "Cassia Valen" three weeks ago)
- **Crate of spices** (worth 100gp, also stolen from Valen)

**The Truth:** Oleg bought stolen goods from thieves. Silk merchant (Cassia Valen—same woman offering caravan job!) is looking for her stolen cargo. Rats nested in cache. Oleg hired PCs to kill rats without discovering the theft.

### **Moral Choice**

**Option 1: Complete Contract as Stated**
- Kill rats, collect tails, return to Oleg
- Get paid 50gp, no complications
- **Consequence:** Oleg keeps stolen goods, Valen never recovers losses
- **Alignment:** Neutral, pragmatic, "not my problem"

**Option 2: Expose Oleg**
- Take evidence to Cassia Valen
- She rewards you 75gp for recovery
- Oleg arrested, you make enemy of merchant network (they see you as rat)
- **Consequence:** +1 Reputation with honest merchants, -1 Reputation with grey market
- **Alignment:** Lawful, "do the right thing"

**Option 3: Blackmail Oleg**
- Confront Oleg with evidence
- Demand 100gp to keep quiet (Intimidation or Persuasion DC 14)
- Success: Oleg pays, you keep contract bonus too (150gp total)
- Failure: Oleg refuses, threatens to tell guild you're shaking down clients
- **Consequence:** +50gp but Oleg is lifelong enemy, no reputation change
- **Alignment:** Chaotic, opportunistic, "get paid twice"

**Option 4: Fence the Goods Yourself**
- Take the silk, sell it at Grey Market (DC 15 Persuasion, 400gp if successful)
- Tell Oleg the rats ate everything, no evidence
- Oleg suspects but can't prove anything
- Tell Valen you found nothing
- **Consequence:** Maximum profit (450gp total) but both clients suspect you
- **Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral, pure opportunism

**Option 5: Return Goods to Valen, Don't Report Oleg**
- Give silk to Valen, claim you "found it" during rat extermination
- Valen rewards you 75gp, grateful
- Don't tell her about Oleg (honor among thieves)
- Tell Oleg the rats destroyed the goods, collect 50gp
- **Consequence:** 125gp total, +1 Reputation with merchants (both), seen as discreet
- **Alignment:** Neutral Good, help victim without destroying thief

### **Returning to VARAK**

Regardless of choice, PCs return to guild with rat tails (proof of completion).

**Varak's Response (varies by choice):**

**If completed cleanly:** *"Rats dead. Client satisfied. You did the job. That's all that matters. Iron Guild membership approved. Here's your mark."*

**If you exposed Oleg:** *"Heard you turned in your client. Interesting choice. Merchants are gossiping about you—some love it, others won't work with a rat. Hope the righteousness was worth it. Still, you completed the contract technically. Membership approved."*

**If you fenced the goods:** *"I'm hearing rumors about extra goods being sold at the Grey Market. Same goods your client was worried about. Interesting timing. I don't care—not my business—but be careful. People remember opportunists."*

**Outcome:**
- ✅ Iron Guild membership granted
- 💰 Gold varies by choice (50-450gp)
- 📊 Reputation shifts based on actions
- 🎭 Established moral compass (or lack thereof)

---

### **Quest 1.1B: Debt Collection**

**If PCs choose this contract:**

**Client Meeting:** Vareth Goldtooth

**Read Aloud:**

> *Vareth's office is in the back of the Temple of the Coin—the gambling hall masquerading as a place of worship. The halfling sits behind a desk too large for him, surrounded by ledgers and counting gold. His fingers are literally covered in gold rings. His smile shows gold teeth. Everything about him screams "predator."*
>
> *"Ah, debt collectors! Wonderful! Yes, yes, Thomas Redhill owes me 100 gold. Three months overdue. Very disappointing. I need you to collect—by any means necessary. Broken fingers, broken legs, whatever motivates him. Just don't kill him. Dead men don't pay."*
>
> *He slides a small pouch across the desk.*
>
> *"Your advance—25 gold. Collect the debt, bring me the coin, I'll pay you the other 50. There's a 10 gold bonus if you make it public. Let people see what happens when you don't pay Vareth. Good for business."*

**If PCs ask questions:**

**"Why doesn't he pay?":** *"Claims he doesn't have it! Can you believe that? Then he shouldn't have borrowed it. Not my problem. That's why I hire you—you make it his problem."*

**"What was the loan for?":** *"Medicine for his daughter. She was sick. Very tragic. But charity doesn't pay my bills. The girl lived—that's more than enough charity from me."*

**"What if he really doesn't have the money?":** *"Then you take collateral. His house. His tools. His fingers. I don't care. Just make sure he pays—or everyone sees what happens when you don't."*

**"Can we negotiate payment terms?":** *"With him? Sure, if you can get blood from a stone. With me? 100 gold, plus the interest that's accumulated. 125 total now. Non-negotiable."*

**The Debtor's Home**

**Read Aloud:**

> *Thomas Redhill's house is a small cottage on the poor side of town. The thatching needs repair. The windows are cracked. A child's toy lies forgotten in the muddy yard. Smoke rises from the chimney—someone's home.*
>
> *You knock. After a long pause, the door cracks open. A man in his thirties peers out—gaunt, tired, afraid. His eyes go to your weapons. He knows why you're here.*

**NPC: Thomas Redhill**

*Medium humanoid (human), neutral good*

**Appearance:** Early 30s, thin from stress, carpenter's hands, haunted eyes, loves his daughter desperately

**Stats:** Use **Commoner**, will not fight (HP 4, AC 10)

**Personality:**
- Desperate but not violent
- Loves his daughter more than life
- Willing to beg, grovel, anything to protect her
- Honest to a fault (admits he can't pay)

**Thomas's Story (if PCs talk instead of attack):**

*"I know why you're here. I know I owe Vareth. I'm not disputing it. My daughter was dying—fever that wouldn't break. The healers wanted 100 gold upfront. I didn't have it. Vareth offered a loan.*

*The girl lived. Thank the gods, she lived. But then I lost my job—the carpenter I worked for went bankrupt. I've been looking for work, I swear. I can pay... just not yet. Please. Give me one more month. I'll pay double—125, like he wants. Just... please don't hurt my daughter. She's only seven."*

**The Daughter:** If PCs investigate, they can meet **Lily Redhill** (7 years old, innocent, friendly, completely unaware of danger). She's drawing pictures of flowers. Seeing her makes the situation very real.

**the choice**

**Option 1: Collect By Force**
- Beat Thomas (Athletics or Intimidation check)
- Take what he has (~30gp in household goods)
- Break his fingers/hands (prevents him from working for months)
- Public beating for 10gp bonus
- **Consequence:** You're paid 75-85gp, Thomas and Lily destitute, your first step toward being a monster
- **Alignment:** Evil or Chaotic Neutral (pure pragmatism)

**Option 2: Give Him More Time**
- Tell Vareth that Thomas "needs one more month to gather funds"
- Vareth is suspicious but agrees (he wants paid, after all)
- Return in one month (side quest) to check
- **Consequence:** Vareth watches you closely, Thomas might actually pay or flee, you've shown mercy
- **Alignment:** Neutral Good, compassionate pragmatism

**Option 3: Pay His Debt Yourself**
- Cover the 125gp from your own funds
- Tell Vareth the debt is paid, don't mention it was you
- Thomas never knows who saved him
- **Consequence:** You're out 125gp but gain nothing material, pure altruism, Vareth doesn't care who pays
- **Alignment:** Lawful Good, heroic sacrifice

**Option 4: Fake Intimidation**
- Stage a beating (fake), Thomas plays along
- Take his "payment" (goods he was going to sell anyway ~30gp)
- Report to Vareth that Thomas is terrified and paying in installments
- **Consequence:** Vareth satisfied, Thomas keeps home, you've bent the rules, Thomas grateful
- **Alignment:** Chaotic Good, subverting system

**Option 5: Rob Vareth for Thomas**
- Realize Vareth is the real villain
- Break into Vareth's office, steal 125gp
- Give it to Thomas, tell him to "find it" and pay Vareth
- **Consequence:** High risk (DC 18 Stealth to succeed), if caught you're hunted, if successful you're Robin Hood
- **Alignment:** Chaotic Good, vigilante justice

**Option 6: Negotiate with Vareth**
- Return to Vareth, argue Thomas can't pay if he's broken (Persuasion DC 16)
- Propose payment plan: Thomas pays 15gp/month for 9 months
- Vareth accepts (he makes more on interest) if check succeeds
- **Consequence:** Everyone satisfied, practical solution, you're now middleman for future payments
- **Alignment:** Lawful Neutral, system-working mediator

**Option 7: Kill Thomas, Fake Evidence of Payment**
- Murder Thomas (makes it look like he paid and fled)
- Forge evidence showing payment
- Tell Vareth the debtor "paid and left town"
- **Consequence:** 75gp profit, murder of innocent, daughter becomes orphan, you've become hitman
- **Alignment:** Evil, sociopathic

### **Returning to VARETH**

**Vareth's Response (varies by choice):**

**If you collected by force:** *"Good work! I can always count on professionals. People need to learn—don't borrow what you can't repay. Here's your gold. Come back anytime—I always have collection jobs."*

**If you gave extension:** *"One month. That's it. If he doesn't pay then, I expect you to break both his legs. Understand? Good. Here's your base pay—you'll get the bonus when he pays."*

**If you negotiated installments:** *"A payment plan? Interesting. More interest for me, less immediate cash. But you're right—can't squeeze blood from corpse. You're thinking like a businessman. I appreciate that."*

**If you paid his debt:** *"Debt's paid. I don't care who paid it. Here's your collection fee. Though I notice Thomas didn't sell his house... Interesting. Whatever. Not my concern."*

### **Returning to VARAK**

**Varak's Response:**

*"Client satisfied. Debt handled. You completed the contract. Whether you did it with fists or diplomacy or your own coin—doesn't matter to me. You fulfilled the terms. That's what matters. Iron Guild membership approved."*

**If you showed mercy:**

*"I'm hearing you went easy on the debtor. Soft, some would say. Others would say smart—hard to collect from a corpse. I'm in the second camp. Pragmatism beats brutality. Usually. Don't let it become a pattern—people will see you as weak."*

**If you were brutal:**

*"You made an example of him. Message sent. Word's spreading—you're not someone to cross. That's good for business. Just remember: fear works until someone stops being afraid and starts being vengeful. Watch your back."*

**Outcome:**
- ✅ Iron Guild membership granted
- 💰 Gold varies by choice (50-85gp, minus any you spent)
- 📊 Reputation: Ruthless OR Merciful OR Mediator
- 🎭 First major moral choice defines character

---

### **Quest 1.1C: Caravan Guard**

**If PCs choose this contract:**

**Client Meeting:** Merchant Cassia Valen

**Read Aloud:**

> *Cassia Valen's wagon is parked near the town gate, loaded and ready. She's a sharp-featured woman in expensive traveling clothes, checking cargo lists with practiced efficiency. When you approach, she sizes you up with a merchant's eye—calculating your worth in gold.*
>
> *"Guild mercenaries? Good. I need guards for a simple escort. The cargo goes to Millford—twenty miles north. Standard bandit territory but nothing serious. We leave at dawn, arrive by dusk. Stay alert, keep the wagon safe, get paid. Simple enough for first-timers?"*

**If PCs ask questions:**

**"What's in the wagon?":** *"Textiles and spices. Trade goods. Boring stuff but valuable to me. Contents aren't your concern—your concern is keeping bandits away from it."*

**"Why not hire cheaper guards?":** *"Because cheap guards let cargo get stolen. I'm paying for professionals. Don't make me regret it."*

**"What kind of bandits?":** *"The usual kind. Desperate men with swords. Maybe 4-6 if you're unlucky. Nothing you can't handle if you're competent."*

**"Payment terms?":** *"Half now, half on delivery. 30 gold now, 30 when we reach Millford safely. Non-negotiable."*

**Investigation/Perception:** 
- **DC 13 Perception:** One crate is sealed with extra locks, different markings
- **DC 15 Investigation:** The "textile" crates are heavier than they should be
- **DC 18 Insight:** Cassia is nervous about something, not the usual merchant worry

**If PCs press about the special crate:**

*"That's my personal cargo. Private. Not your concern. You're being paid to protect the wagon, not ask questions. Are we clear?"*

### **The Journey**

**Travel Time:** 6-8 hours (one long rest not possible during one day trip)

**Read Aloud:**

> *The road north is well-traveled but lonely. Forests press close on both sides. Cassia drives the wagon in silence, eyes scanning the treeline. Morning passes without incident. Around midday, as you round a bend, you see them—six figures blocking the road ahead. Armed. Waiting.*

**THE "BANDITS"**

**Read Aloud:**

> *The leader steps forward—a woman in leather armor, sword drawn but lowered. Her voice is clear, official, commanding:*
>
> *"This is a Crown Inspection! By authority of the Kingdom of Thaldros, stop your vehicle and prepare for cargo search! We have reason to believe you're transporting illegal contraband!"*
>
> *Cassia's face goes pale. She mutters: "Shit. They know."*

**The Truth:**

These aren't bandits—they're **Thaldros Revenue Officers** (basically fantasy customs/drug enforcement):

**Enemies:**
- 1 **Officer Captain** (use Knight stats, CR 3)
- 5 **Officers** (use Guard stats, CR 1/8 each)

**They ARE:**
- Lawful (mostly)
- Following legitimate orders
- Have arrest warrant for Cassia Valen (smuggling)
- Will try to arrest peacefully first
- Will fight if resisted

**Officer Captain's Demand:**

*"Cassia Valen, you're under arrest for smuggling narcotics across kingdom borders. Mercenaries—stand down. You're not wanted for anything. Walk away now and there's no charges. Defend a smuggler and you're accessories. Choose wisely."*

**Cassia's Plea:**

*"Don't listen to them! They're trying to steal my cargo! I'm paying you to protect it—that's the contract! Do your job!"*

**the choice**

**Option 1: Defend the Wagon (Fight)**
- Fight 6 law enforcement officers
- Combat (CR 4 encounter, deadly for level 1)
- If you win: Cassia pays you, but you're now wanted for assaulting officers
- If you lose: Arrested, fined, or forced to flee
- **Consequence:** 60gp, wanted status, contract honored, Cassia is ally
- **Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral, "contract is contract"

**Option 2: Surrender the Wagon (Betray Client)**
- Let officers arrest Cassia
- Turn over the wagon
- Officers thank you for cooperating
- **Consequence:** No payment from Cassia (she's arrested), officers pay you 20gp "for your trouble," clean reputation with law, Cassia is enemy (if she escapes)
- **Alignment:** Lawful Neutral, "law is law"

**Option 3: Negotiate with Captain**
- Persuasion DC 16: "Cassia wasn't fully honest with us about cargo. We're just hired guards. Let us walk away clean?"
- Success: Captain lets PCs leave, arrests Cassia, no charges filed against you
- Failure: Captain demands you help arrest Cassia or you're accessories
- **Consequence:** No payment, but no criminal record, neutral outcome
- **Alignment:** Neutral, self-preservation

**Option 4: Help Cassia Escape**
- Create distraction (Deception/Performance DC 14)
- Cassia flees in confusion while officers focus on you
- You surrender peacefully after she's gone
- **Consequence:** Arrested briefly, fined 20gp, Cassia escapes and later rewards you 100gp secretly, you have friend in smuggling network
- **Alignment:** Chaotic Good, help client without killing officers

**Option 5: Bribe the Captain**
- Offer captain half the cargo value (~200gp worth of narcotics)
- Persuasion DC 18 (risky—officer might be honorable)
- Success: Captain takes bribe, lets everyone go
- Failure: Captain arrests you for attempted bribery
- **Consequence:** If successful, Cassia pays you double (120gp) for "thinking fast," you've corrupted law enforcement
- **Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral, corruption

**Option 6: Report Cassia to Varak**
- During journey, realize cargo is illegal
- Stop the wagon, tell Cassia you're returning to Crossroads
- Report her to Iron Guild for violating contract terms (she lied about cargo)
- Guild confiscates wagon, arrests Cassia
- **Consequence:** Guild appreciates your integrity, pays you 40gp from seized assets, Cassia imprisoned, you're "boy scout"
- **Alignment:** Lawful Good, guild honor

### **Combat Tactics (If Fight Occurs)**

**Officers' Tactics:**
- Captain orders: "Take them alive if possible!"
- Use non-lethal attacks when PC drops below 5 HP
- Focus on disarming rather than killing
- Call for surrender after downing 1-2 PCs
- Retreat and call for reinforcements if losing badly

**Cassia's Actions:**
- Stays on wagon, tries to escape during chaos
- Won't fight (she's a merchant, not a warrior)
- If wagon is about to be taken, she destroys evidence (burns the special crate)
- If captured, she blames PCs: "They knew! They were in on it!"

### **Returning to VARAK**

**Varak's Response (varies wildly by choice):**

**If you fought officers:** *"You assaulted kingdom revenue officers for a smuggler? Brave or stupid—I haven't decided. The contract said protect the cargo. You did. Technically. But now you're wanted. That complicates future contracts. Hope the coin was worth it. Membership approved—but watch your back."*

**If you betrayed Cassia:** *"You handed your client to the authorities. Pragmatic. Some clients won't hire you now—word spreads about mercenaries who turn on employers. But law-abiding clients will love you. Double-edged sword. Membership approved. Choose your reputation carefully."*

**If you negotiated clean exit:** *"You survived without fighting and without betraying anyone. Smart. Neutral parties respect neutrality. You showed discretion. That's valuable. Membership approved."*

**If you helped her escape:** *"Cassia's gone. Officers are angry. But you didn't assault anyone and you didn't get caught. Clever. Cassia's leaving you dead drops with payments—she's grateful. You made an ally in the smuggling world. Useful. Membership approved."*

**The Lesson:**

Varak concludes (regardless of choice):

*"You just learned a valuable lesson: clients lie. Always. The rat exterminator was fencing goods. The loan shark was a predator. The merchant was a smuggler. Everyone has an agenda. Your job isn't to judge—it's to decide what you can live with. Some mercenaries have lines they won't cross. Others don't. Figure out what kind you are before someone else figures it out for you."*

**Outcome:**
- ✅ Iron Guild membership (probably)
- 💰 Gold varies wildly by choice (0-120gp)
- 📊 Reputation: Law-Abiding OR Outlaw OR Neutral
- 🎭 Learn that clients always lie

## 🎖️ Iron Guild Membership

After completing Quest 1.1, PCs receive Iron Guild membership (assuming they didn't catastrophically fail).

### **Membership Benefits:**

- Identifies you as guild member
- Killing guild member without contract = death sentence from guild

**2. Barracks Access**
- Free basic lodging at guild hall
- Access to training yard
- Common meals (not fancy, but free)

**3. Contract Access**
- Private contract board (better jobs, higher pay)
- Varak's network (he shares intel on clients)
- Priority for high-value contracts

**4. Protection**
- Guild backs its members
- If someone attacks you without cause, guild investigates
- Guild has your back legally (to a point)

**5. Resources**

**Dues:** 10% of all contract earnings, paid monthly  
**Rules:**
- Honor contracts (break one = death)
- Don't kill guild members without contract
- Don't steal from guild members
- Report major crimes to Varak (guild's reputation matters)

**Consequences OF Breaking Rules:**

**Minor Infractions:** Fine (50-200gp)  
**Major Infractions:** Expulsion from guild

**Varak's Response if Refused:**

*"Your choice. Some mercenaries prefer independence. Just remember—when someone puts a knife in your back, don't come crying to me. The guild protects its own. If you're not one of us, you're on your own. Door's always open if you change your mind—if you're still alive."*

---

## ⏭️ Transition TO QUEST 1.2

After completing Quest 1.1 and deciding on guild membership, the campaign enters a brief "downtime" phase (1-2 days in-game).

**Downtime Activities:**

PCs can spend this time:
- Exploring Crossroads
- Meeting more NPCs
- Shopping for gear
- Training (if desired)
- Rest and recovery
- Establishing routines

**Key NPCs to Meet:**

**Mira Copperstone** (information broker)
- Sells rumors: 5-50gp depending on value
- Knows everyone's secrets
- Can provide intel on future contracts

**Captain Kael Darkwater** (rival recruiter)

- Sells illegal items (poisons, etc.)

### **The Next Contract**

After 1-2 days, Varak summons PCs to guild hall:

**Read Aloud:**

> *Varak's office is more crowded than usual. Two men stand before his desk, glaring at each other. One is a noble in expensive clothing, sword at his hip, entitled bearing. The other is younger, in merchant's garb, nervous but determined. Both are talking over each other, making demands.*
>
> *Varak spots you entering. Relief crosses his face—briefly. He holds up a hand for silence.*
>
> *"Enough. Both of you. You want the same thing. You're bidding for the same mercenaries. Let them decide. And whichever one they don't choose... find someone else."*
>
> *He turns to you.*
>
> *"Two clients. Same target. Different employers. Different pay. Different stories. Choose one. Or don't. But this is the business we're in."*

**This begins Quest 1.2: The Price of Loyalty...**

## DM Guidance Notes

### **Quest 1.1 Design Philosophy**

This quest teaches players the core themes of Blood & Coin:

1. **Clients Lie** - Every single contract has hidden truth
2. **No Clear Morality** - Every choice has pros and cons
3. **Consequences Matter** - Choices establish reputation
4. **Pragmatism vs Idealism** - Both are valid, both have costs
5. **Money Matters** - Gold differences actually mean something

### **Adapting to Player Choices**

The key to running this quest well is **not judging player choices**. The DM should:

✅ Present situations neutrally  
✅ Show consequences (not punishments)  
✅ Let PCs feel the weight of choices  
✅ Respect different moral frameworks  
✅ Track reputation changes for later use  

❌ Don't moralize at the table  
❌ Don't punish "evil" choices mechanically  
❌ Don't reward "good" choices artificially  
❌ Don't railroad toward specific outcome  

### **Pacing Notes**

**Session 1:**
- Character introductions (30 min)
- Arrival at Crossroads (15 min)
- Meeting Finn and Mira (30 min)
- Meeting Varak, choosing contract (45 min)

**Session 2:**
- Complete chosen contract (2-3 hours)
- Return to Varak, get membership
- Brief downtime, meet more NPCs
- Hook for Quest 1.2

### **Difficulty Adjustments**

**If Party Struggles:**
- Reduce rat count to 5-6
- Give Thomas 50gp in goods he can pay with
- Have officers be less competent fighters

**If Party Dominates:**
- Add 2-3 more rats
- Have Vareth demand more aggressive collection
- Add 2 more officers to road stop

### **Branching Consequences**

Track these for later quests:

**Reputation Types:**
- Ruthless (brutal methods)
- Merciful (showed compassion)
- Pragmatic (chose middle path)
- Law-Abiding (sided with authorities)
- Outlaw (opposed law)
- Opportunistic (maximized profit)

**Ally/Enemy Status:**
- Oleg Tharn (ally/enemy)
- Cassia Valen (ally/enemy)
- Thomas Redhill (grateful/dead/unaware)
- Vareth Goldtooth (satisfied/suspicious)
- Thaldros Officers (neutral/hostile)

These will come back in Acts II and III!

**Quest 1.1 Complete - Ready for DM Use**

This quest alone is ~8,000 words of fully playable content. PCs will spend 1-2 sessions on it and learn everything they need to know about the campaign's tone.

## 🎯 Quest 1.2: The PRICE OF LOYALTY

**Level:** 2  
**Duration:** 2-3 sessions  
**Objective:** Choose between competing clients with opposite goals  
**Key NPCs:** Baron Darius Thornhill, Thomas Redwood, Elara Thornhill  
**Rewards:** 150-200gp (varies), permanent enemy made, lasting consequences  
**Theme:** "You can't serve two masters"

### **Quest SETUP**

After 1-2 days of downtime following Quest 1.1, Varak summons the PCs to the guild hall. This time, things are different—there's tension in the air.

**Read Aloud:**

> *You arrive at the guild hall to find it more crowded than usual. Two groups of mercenaries eye each other warily from opposite sides of the room. Hands rest on weapon hilts. The air crackles with potential violence.*
>
> *Varak sits at his desk, jaw clenched, clearly irritated. Two men stand before him, both talking at once:*
>
> *On the left: A nobleman in expensive clothing, mid-40s, imperious bearing, hand on his sword. His voice is commanding, entitled: "I offered first! The contract is MINE!"*
>
> *On the right: A younger man in merchant's clothing, nervous but determined, clutching a heavy coin purse: "I'm offering more gold! That's how this works!"*
>
> *Varak slams his fist on the desk. Silence falls.*
>
> *"Enough. You both want mercenaries for the same target. Same woman. Different reasons. I don't care about your family drama—this is business. The guild doesn't take sides in personal disputes."*
>
> *He turns to you.*
>
> *"Two clients. Same target. Opposite goals. One wants her brought back. One wants her protected. Choose one contract. The other will hire someone else—probably to fight you. This is the business we're in. Choose wisely."*

### **The Competing Clients**

Both clients present their case. Let them argue, interrupt each other, appeal to the PCs. This should feel chaotic, uncomfortable, real.

---

### **Client A: Baron Darius Thornhill**

**NPC: Baron Darius Thornhill**

*Medium humanoid (human), lawful neutral (thinks he's lawful good)*

**Appearance:** Mid-40s, graying temples, expensive noble clothing, ornate longsword, military bearing, entitled but not cruel

**Personality:**
- Authoritarian father who "knows what's best"
- Genuinely loves his daughter (in his way)
- Views commoners as beneath his family
- Not evil, just classist and controlling
- Believes he's protecting his daughter

**Stats:** Use **Noble** with combat training (+2 longsword, 30 HP)

**Baron's Pitch:**

> *"My daughter, Elara, has been kidnapped—no, seduced—by a common merchant. A nobody. Thomas Redwood. He's filled her head with romantic nonsense about 'true love' and 'freedom.' She's nineteen, naive, doesn't understand the world.*
>
> *Three weeks ago, she disappeared. Left a note saying she was 'following her heart.' I have it on good authority she's hiding in a cottage five miles north with this... boy. He's probably using her for her family's money and connections.*
>
> *Your job: Retrieve my daughter. Bring her home. Unharmed. I don't care about the boy—kill him, let him go, whatever. Just bring Elara back. She belongs with her family.*
>
> *Payment: 200 gold pieces. Plus, I'll owe you a favor—a noble's favor is worth more than gold in this kingdom."*

**If PCs ask questions:**

**"Why do you think she was kidnapped?":** *"Because she would never leave willingly. She knows her duty to the family. He must have enchanted her somehow—magic or manipulation, doesn't matter."*

**"What if she wants to stay with him?":** *"She's nineteen. She doesn't know what she wants. I'm her father. It's my duty to protect her from her own foolishness. She'll thank me when she's older."*

**"Will you hurt the merchant?":** *"If he resists? Yes. If he's smart enough to walk away? No. I'm not a monster. But if he's harmed my daughter in any way, I'll have him executed. Legally."*

**"What about Elara's wishes?":** *"She's a child. Children don't get to make adult decisions. This isn't about what she wants—it's about what's right. What's safe. What's proper."*

**Insight DC 14:** The Baron genuinely believes he's protecting his daughter. He loves her, but in a controlling, possessive way. He sees Thomas as a threat, not because he's evil, but because he's "inappropriate."

---

### **Client B: THOMAS REDWOOD**

**NPC: Thomas Redwood** (not the same Thomas from Quest 1.1)

*Medium humanoid (human), neutral good*

**Appearance:** Early 20s, merchant's son, clean-cut, earnest, scared but determined, wearing simple but quality clothing, obviously in love

**Personality:**
- Genuinely loves Elara
- Not fortune hunter (his family is modestly wealthy)
- Idealistic but practical
- Willing to fight for love but prefers peace
- Fears the Baron but won't abandon Elara

**Stats:** Use **Commoner** with +2 Persuasion, +3 Insight (22 HP from determination)

**Thomas's Pitch:**

> *"Please, hear me out. The Baron is lying—or deluded. Elara wasn't kidnapped. She chose to leave. She chose me. We're in love. We want to marry.*
>
> *But her father won't allow it because I'm a merchant's son, not nobility. As if love cares about bloodlines! We ran away three weeks ago because he threatened to marry her off to some old duke for political alliance.*
>
> *She's not a child—she's nineteen, an adult. This is her choice. But I know the Baron. He'll send mercenaries. He'll send assassins. He'll never stop until he gets her back.*
>
> *I'm offering 150 gold—everything I have saved—to protect us. To protect her. Just for a few weeks until we can reach the free territories where the Baron has no legal authority. Then we can start a new life.*
>
> *Please. Don't let him take her back. She'll be trapped in a gilded cage for the rest of her life."*

**If PCs ask questions:**

**"How do we know she really loves you?":** *"Talk to her yourself. She's at the cottage. She'll tell you. She chose this. She chose me."*

**"Why not just explain this to her father?":** *"We tried. He refused to listen. He called me a gold-digger, said I'd enchanted her. He had his guards beat me and throw me out. That's when we ran."*

**"What if the Baron attacks?":** *"That's why I need you. I can't fight trained soldiers. I'm a merchant, not a warrior. But I won't let her go back. I'd rather die."*

**"What about her family? Won't she miss them?":** *(Pained)* *"Yes. She misses her mother. But her father is a tyrant. He's never let her make her own choices. This is her first real decision—and it's to choose love over duty."*

**Insight DC 12:** Thomas is telling the truth. He's genuinely in love. He's not after money—his own family is comfortable. He's terrified but determined.

---

### **The Decision Moment**

Varak interrupts:

> *"Enough. I've heard both sides. You're both paying customers. The guild doesn't judge morality—we judge contracts. Both are legitimate.*
>
> *Here's how this works: The mercenaries choose one contract. The other client leaves and finds different mercenaries. Then you'll probably end up fighting each other over this girl. That's the business."*
>
> *He looks at you.*
>
> *"So. Baron offers 200 gold and a noble's favor. Merchant offers 150 gold and gratitude. Baron wants girl brought back. Merchant wants her protected. Choose. Now."*

**Important:** Give players time to discuss. This is a major choice. Let them debate. Some might want the money. Others might care about morality. Some might try to negotiate (won't work—both clients are stubborn).

### **The CHOICE**

**Option 1: Accept Baron's Contract**
- Work for the noble
- Higher pay (200gp + favor)
- Orders: Retrieve Elara, don't harm her, merchant is irrelevant
- Thomas hires rival mercenaries (3 level 2 fighters) to protect them

**Option 2: Accept Thomas's Contract**  
- Work for the lovers
- Lower pay (150gp) but morally clearer
- Orders: Protect Elara and Thomas from Baron's mercenaries
- Baron hires rival mercenaries (4 level 2 fighters) to retrieve Elara

**Option 3: Refuse Both**
- Walk away, no payment
- Both clients hire other mercenaries
- PCs stay out of it
- **Consequence:** Varak respects neutrality but warns you'll make enemies either way by not choosing

**Option 4: Try to Mediate** (Persuasion DC 20, very hard)
- Attempt to broker peace between father and daughter
- If successful: Baron agrees to meet with Elara one time, no guards
- If failed: Both clients think you're wasting their time, both hire other mercenaries
- If mediation works (rare), both pay half (175gp combined), no one fights

### **Investigating The Truth**

Smart players might want to verify claims before choosing.

**Option: Visit the Cottage First**

Both clients agree (reluctantly) to let PCs investigate before deciding.

**the cottage**

**Read Aloud:**

> *The cottage is small but well-kept, five miles north of Crossroads. Smoke rises from the chimney. Flowers grow in window boxes—someone planted them recently. A young woman tends a small garden out front, humming to herself. She looks up as you approach.*
>
> *She's pretty—dark hair, nobleman's features, but dressed in simple peasant clothing. Her hands are dirty from gardening. She looks... happy. Content. Free.*
>
> *She sees you. Her hand goes to her belt—a small knife. Her expression hardens.*
>
> *"More mercenaries? Did my father send you? Tell him I'm not going back."*

**NPC: Elara Thornhill**

*Medium humanoid (human), neutral good*

**Appearance:** 19 years old, dark hair, nobleman's features, simple clothing, sun-tanned (new for her), calloused hands from work, defiant eyes

**Personality:**
- Strong-willed, not naive
- Knows what she wants
- Loves her mother but resents her father
- Has thought this through carefully
- Not being controlled or enchanted—this is her choice

**Stats:** Use **Commoner** (4 HP), will not fight but will run

**Elara's Truth:**

If PCs talk to her peacefully:

> *"Let me guess—my father told you I was kidnapped? Enchanted? That I'm a silly girl who doesn't know her own mind?*
>
> *I'm nineteen. I'm an adult. I know exactly what I'm doing. I love Thomas. He loves me. We want to build a life together. But my father sees me as property—a trading piece for political alliances.*
>
> *He was arranging my marriage to Duke Harmond. The man is forty-five years old. He's buried two wives already. My father didn't ask my opinion—he just told me it was 'decided.'*
>
> *So yes, I left. I chose Thomas. I chose freedom. I chose love over duty. And I'm not going back.*
>
> *If you're here to drag me back... you'll have to tie me up and carry me. I won't go willingly. And I'll hate every mercenary who helps my father cage me again."*

**Insight DC 10:** She's telling the truth. She's not enchanted, not manipulated. This is genuine choice.

**If PCs ask about Thomas:**

*"Thomas is kind. He's gentle. He's the first person who ever asked what I wanted instead of telling me. His family is wealthy enough—he's not after my father's gold. He wants me. Just me. That's enough."*

**If PCs ask about her mother:**

*"I miss her. Gods, I miss her. But she won't stand up to father. She never has. She told me once, 'Sometimes we sacrifice freedom for security.' I refuse to make that trade."*

**If PCs mention Duke Harmond:**

*"He's not evil. Just... old. Boring. Entitled. He views me as decoration—a young wife to produce heirs. That's my entire value to these men. My father sees a political alliance. Harmond sees a breeding mare. Only Thomas sees Elara."*

### **The Truth Revealed**

After investigating, players should understand:

✅ Elara was NOT kidnapped  
✅ She chose to leave willingly  
✅ Thomas is genuinely in love, not a con artist  
✅ Baron is controlling but loves his daughter (in his way)  
✅ This is about freedom vs. family duty  
✅ No clear villain—just opposing values

**Now players must choose despite having all the facts.**

---

## Branching Paths

### **Path A: Working For The Baron**

If PCs accept Baron's contract:

**Phase 1: The Approach**

Baron provides:
- Map to cottage
- Description of Elara
- 100gp upfront, 100gp on delivery
- Orders: "Bring her back alive. Unharmed. Use force only if necessary."

**Read Aloud:**

> *You approach the cottage at dusk. As expected, Thomas Redwood is outside, chopping firewood. He sees you coming. His face falls. He knows why you're here.*
>
> *He drops the axe and sprints inside, shouting: "Elara! They're here! The Baron sent them!"*
>
> *Moments later, Elara appears in the doorway. Behind her, three armed figures emerge from the cottage—mercenaries. Thomas hired protection.*
>
> *One of them, a scarred woman with a crossbow, calls out: "You're trespassing. Leave now or we make you leave."*

**Encounter:** 3 **Rival Mercenaries** (Thomas's hired guards)

- 1 **Fighter** (Female leader, CR 1) - Uses Longsword, shield
- 2 **Thugs** (Male guards, CR 1/2 each) - Use clubs, pack tactics

**Tactics:**
- Mercenaries defend the cottage, don't pursue
- Leader shouts: "We don't want to fight! Just leave them alone!"
- If PCs attack, they defend but try for non-lethal (don't want murder charges)
- If leader drops below 10 HP, she calls retreat
- Thomas and Elara barricade inside cottage during fight

**Non-Combat Options:**

**Option: Negotiation** (Persuasion DC 16)
- Offer rival mercenaries MORE money to walk away (requires 100gp bribe)
- Success: They leave, apologize to Thomas, "business is business"
- Failure: They refuse, see PCs as dishonorable

**Option: Intimidation** (DC 15)
- Threaten rivals with guild backing or superior numbers
- Success: They back down, leave angry
- Failure: They attack out of pride

**Option: Deception** (DC 17)
- Lie about Baron's intentions ("He just wants to talk!")
- Success: Rivals lower guard, can be surprised or convinced to mediate
- Failure: They attack, angry at deception

**Phase 2: Elara's Resistance**

Once rivals are dealt with (fought, bribed, or convinced), face Elara:

**Read Aloud:**

> *The cottage door opens. Elara stands there, knife in hand—useless against armed mercenaries, but she's not going quietly. Thomas stands behind her, protective but helpless.*
>
> *"So you chose him," Elara says bitterly. "You chose gold over doing the right thing. Typical. My father knew exactly what mercenaries to hire."*
>
> *She raises the knife—not to attack, but to her own throat.*
>
> *"I won't go back. I'd rather die free than live in a cage. You'll have to bring him my corpse. Tell him I loved him, but I loved freedom more."*

**The Hostage Situation:**

**Option 1: Call Her Bluff** (Insight DC 15 to see if she's serious)
- If she's bluffing: She lowers knife, breaks down crying, gives up
- If she's serious: She cuts herself (1d4 damage), demands you leave
- **DM Note:** She IS serious. This is her last stand.

**Option 2: Disarm Her** (Athletics or Acrobatics DC 14, opposed check)
- Success: Grab the knife, restrain her
- Failure: She cuts herself (1d6 damage), screams for Thomas

**Option 3: Convince Her** (Persuasion DC 18, very hard)
- Argue that Baron loves her, will listen, she can negotiate terms
- Success: She agrees to meet father with YOU as mediators
- Failure: She refuses, threatens self-harm

**Option 4: Knock Her Out** (Non-lethal attack)
- Hit her unconscious, tie her up
- Thomas attacks you (futilely, easily subdued)
- **Consequence:** Most brutal option, but "completes" contract

**Option 5: Walk Away**
- Refuse to force her
- Return to Baron, report she'd rather die
- Baron is furious, refuses payment, hires assassins to target Thomas
- **Consequence:** Contract broken, reputation hit, but conscience clear

**Phase 3: The Return**

If you successfully retrieve Elara (willing or not):

**Read Aloud:**

> *Baron Thornhill waits at the guild hall. When you bring Elara through the door, his face floods with relief—then hardens when he sees her expression. Hatred. Pure, burning hatred.*
>
> *"Father," she says coldly. "I hope you're happy. You've proven you can buy anything. Even your daughter's freedom."*
>
> *The Baron reaches for her. She flinches away.*
>
> *"Elara... I did this because I love you. You'll understand when—"*
>
> *"When I'm older?" She laughs bitterly. "I understand now. You don't love me. You love controlling me. That's not the same thing."*
>
> *She turns to you.*
>
> *"Enjoy your blood money. I hope it buys you something worth selling your soul for."*

**Baron'S Payment:**

Baron pays the 100gp remainder (total: 200gp).

He offers his "favor" (can be called in later, Act II):
- Access to noble connections
- Letters of introduction
- Legal protection for one crime
- Invitation to high society events

**Consequence Tracking:**

- ✅ Quest complete, contract honored
- 💰 200gp earned
- 📊 +1 Reputation: Law-Abiding, Noble's Ally
- 📊 -2 Reputation: Lovers' Enemy, "Soul Sold"
- 🎭 Elara is returned against her will
- 🎭 Thomas is heartbroken, possibly suicidal
- 🎭 Baron believes he "saved" his daughter
- 🎭 Elara will escape again within weeks (DM option for later)

**What Happens Next:**

One week later, PCs might hear:
- Thomas attempted suicide (survived, barely)
- Elara is locked in her room, refusing food
- Baron hired guards to watch her 24/7
- Rumors of forced marriage to Duke Harmond proceeding

**IF PCs FEEL GUILTY:** That's the point. Welcome to mercenary life.

---

### **Path B: Working For Thomas**

If PCs accept Thomas's contract:

**Phase 1: The Preparation**

Thomas pays 75gp upfront (half), keeps 75gp for supplies.

His plan:
- Hide at cottage for 2 weeks
- Save enough gold to bribe border guards
- Flee to the free territories where Baron has no authority
- Start new life under assumed names

**PCs must:**
- Defend cottage from Baron's mercenaries
- Keep Elara and Thomas safe
- Prevent kidnapping

**Fortifying THE Cottage:**

PCs have 1 day to prepare before attack. Options:

**Option: Set Traps** (Survival DC 13)
- Pit traps, tripwires, caltrops around perimeter
- Success: Attackers have disadvantage on first round
- Failure: Traps ineffective or hurt you

**Option: Barricade Doors** (Athletics DC 12)
- Reinforce cottage, create chokepoints
- Success: +2 AC while inside, advantageous terrain
- Failure: Minimal improvement

**Option: Gather Allies** (Persuasion DC 15)
- Hire more mercenaries with Thomas's gold (50gp)
- Success: 2 level 1 fighters join as backup
- Failure: No one wants to fight against Baron

**Option: Create Escape Route** (Investigation DC 14)
- Dig tunnel/secret exit for emergency escape
- Success: Can evacuate Elara if overwhelmed
- Failure: No escape route

**Phase 2: The Assault**

The next evening, Baron's mercenaries attack:

**Read Aloud:**

> *Sunset. The forest around the cottage grows quiet—too quiet. Birds have stopped singing. Then you see them: Four armed figures emerging from the treeline. Professional. Military bearing. Better equipped than you expected.*
>
> *The leader—a woman in plate armor—raises her hand. Her voice is firm, authoritative:*
>
> *"By order of Baron Thornhill, surrender the girl! You're harboring stolen property! Resist and you'll be charged with kidnapping!"*
>
> *Behind you, in the cottage, Elara whispers: "Please don't let them take me. Please."*

**Encounter:** 4 **Baron's Mercenaries**

- 1 **Veteran** (Female leader, CR 3) - Plate armor, longsword, shield
- 3 **Guards** (Male soldiers, CR 1/8 each) - Chainmail, spears

**Tactics:**
- Leader attempts peaceful surrender first
- If refused, guards advance while leader provides ranged support
- Focus on subduing, not killing (want Elara alive)
- If leader drops below 25 HP, calls retreat
- Guards surrender if leader falls

**Special Complication:**

Halfway through fight (round 3):

**Read Aloud:**

> *Elara screams from inside the cottage. You spin—a fifth mercenary, a rogue, has infiltrated through a window! He has Elara in a headlock, knife to throat!*
>
> *"Stop fighting or she dies! Baron wants her alive, but I'm authorized to wound her if necessary! Drop your weapons!"*

**The Hostage Crisis:**

**Option 1: Negotiate** (Persuasion DC 14)
- Offer gold to rogue (100gp)
- Success: He releases her, takes gold, vanishes
- Failure: He demands more or tightens grip

**Option 2: Ranged Attack** (Attack roll at disadvantage)
- Shoot rogue without hitting Elara
- Success (high roll): Rogue drops, Elara safe
- Failure (low roll): Might hit Elara (DM discretion)

**Option 3: Distraction** (Deception DC 13)
- Create diversion, Thomas tackles rogue
- Success: Thomas and rogue grapple, Elara escapes
- Failure: Rogue cuts Elara (1d4 damage), maintains control

**Option 4: Surrender**
- Drop weapons, let them take Elara
- Contract failed, no payment
- But everyone lives

**Resolution:**

If mercenaries are defeated or driven off:

**Read Aloud:**

> *The Baron's mercenaries retreat, dragging wounded with them. Their leader shouts back:*
>
> *"This isn't over! The Baron has resources! He'll send more! You can't protect her forever!"*
>
> *Inside the cottage, Elara is shaking. Thomas holds her. She looks at you:*
>
> *"Thank you. Thank you for choosing us. For choosing love over gold. I won't forget this."*

**Thomas'S Payment:**

Pays the remaining 75gp (total: 150gp).

Also offers:
- Family heirloom: **Merchant's Signet Ring** (worth 100gp, or connections to merchant network)
- Gratitude: Will help PCs in future if possible
- Safe house: Can use cottage as hideout if needed

- PCs are personae non gratae in noble circles

**IF PCs FEEL GOOD:** Enjoy it. Moral victories are rare in this campaign.

---

### **Path C: MEDIATION** (Rare Success Path)

If PCs successfully mediate (DC 20 Persuasion, very difficult):

**The Meeting:**

Baron agrees to meet Elara, no guards, neutral ground (guild hall).

**Read Aloud:**

> *Father and daughter face each other across Varak's desk. The tension could be cut with a knife. Elara's arms are crossed, defiant. The Baron looks older, tired, almost broken.*
>
> *He speaks first: "Elara... I thought I'd lost you."*
>
> *"You did lose me, Father. You lost me when you treated me like property."*
>
> *"I was trying to protect you! The world is dangerous—"*
>
> *"So you wanted to lock me in a tower? Marry me to a stranger? That's not protection. That's control."*
>
> *Silence. The Baron's hand trembles. When he speaks again, his voice cracks:*
>
> *"I love you. You're my daughter. My only daughter. I just... I don't want you to make mistakes that will hurt you."*
>
> *"Then trust me to make my own mistakes. Trust that you raised me well enough to choose for myself."*

**The Negotiation:**

PCs can help mediate. Persuasion checks to find middle ground:

**Option A: Compromise** (DC 15)
- Elara agrees to wait 6 months before marrying Thomas
- Baron agrees to meet Thomas, evaluate him fairly
- If Thomas proves himself worthy (business success), Baron gives blessing
- Both agree to this trial period

**Option B: Conditional Blessing** (DC 16)
- Baron allows marriage IF Thomas proves financial stability
- Elara must visit family monthly
- No forced marriages to others
- Thomas must sign prenup protecting family assets

**Option C: Clean Break** (DC 18)
- Baron releases Elara from family obligations
- She gets modest dowry (500gp) to start new life
- She renounces claim to inheritance
- They part on neutral terms, no hard feelings

**If Successful:**

Both clients pay half their offered amounts:
- Baron pays 100gp
- Thomas pays 75gp
- Total: 175gp

Plus both are grateful:
- Baron's favor (can be called later)
- Thomas's ring and friendship

**Consequence Tracking:**

- ✅ Quest complete, both contracts satisfied
- 💰 175gp earned + ring
- 📊 +3 Reputation: Mediator, Peacemaker, Wise
- 📊 No enemies made
- 🎭 Family healing begins
- 🎭 Rare "good" ending in grey campaign
- 🎭 PCs learn sometimes talking beats fighting

---

### **Path D: Refuse Both Contracts**

If PCs walk away:

**Varak'S Response:**

> *"Walking away. Interesting. Not cowardice—I saw you thinking it through. Sometimes refusing a contract is smarter than taking a bad one.*
>
> *Both clients will hire other mercenaries. You'll probably watch them fight in the streets. Stay out of it or you'll make enemies of both sides.*
>
> *No payment, but no blood on your hands either. Some mercenaries care about that. Most don't survive long, but some do."*

**What Happens:**

One week later, PCs witness the outcome:

**Roll D6:**

**1-2: Baron Wins**
- His mercenaries retrieved Elara by force
- Thomas was beaten, left for dead
- Elara is locked up, miserable
- PCs could have prevented this

**3-4: Thomas Wins**
- His mercenaries fought off Baron's forces
- Elara and Thomas escaped to Aethoria
- Baron is furious, two mercenaries dead
- PCs could have earned gold

**5: Both Sides Bloody**
- Mercenaries fought to mutual destruction
- Multiple deaths, Elara wounded in crossfire
- Thomas killed, Elara returned to Baron
- Everyone loses, PCs could have prevented tragedy

**6: Unexpected Truce**
- Mercenaries refused to fight (too bloody)
- Baron and Thomas negotiated directly
- Compromise reached without PC help
- Everyone lives, PCs missed out on payment and credit

**Consequence Tracking:**

- ⚠️ No quest completion
- 💰 0gp earned
- 📊 +1 Reputation: Neutral, Cautious
- 📊 -1 Reputation: Both clients see you as "unhelpful"
- 🎭 Outcome happens without PC involvement
- 🎭 PCs learn some conflicts resolve themselves
- 🎭 Or don't, and people die

## Aftermath & Epilogue

Regardless of path chosen, Quest 1.2 concludes with:

### **Varak'S Debrief**

**Read Aloud:**

> *Varak pours himself a drink—rare for him. He gestures for you to sit.*
>
> *"That was messy. Family disputes always are. You made a choice. Right or wrong doesn't matter—that's philosophy, not business. What matters is you honored your contract."*
>
> *He leans forward.*
>
> *"But here's the lesson: Every choice makes enemies. Work for the Baron? Thomas hates you. Work for Thomas? Baron hates you. Try to please everyone? They both distrust you. Walk away? They both think you're useless.*
>
> *"There's no 'good' answer in this business. Only choices and consequences. Get used to it. This is what we do."*

### **Level Up**

---

## 📊 DM Guidance: QUEST 1.2

### **Key Themes**

1. **No Clear Right Answer:** Both clients have valid perspectives
2. **Choose Your Enemies:** Every choice makes someone hate you
3. **Love vs Duty:** Explore the conflict between heart and obligation
4. **Consequences Matter:** This choice ripples through campaign

### **Running the Negotiation Scene**

- Let both clients argue passionately
- Make Baron sympathetic (he loves his daughter, just misguided)
- Make Thomas earnest (he's genuine, not a con artist)
- Make Elara strong-willed (not a damsel, an adult making choices)
- **Don't judge player choices** - present both as equally valid contracts

### **Combat Difficulty**

**If PCs Chose Baron:**
- 3 rival mercenaries (1 Fighter CR 1, 2 Thugs CR 1/2)
- CR 2 encounter for party of 4 = Medium

**If PCs Chose Thomas:**
- 4 Baron's mercenaries (1 Veteran CR 3, 3 Guards CR 1/8)
- CR 3.5 encounter for party of 4 = Hard/Deadly
- Add fortification advantages to balance

### **Adjusting Difficulty**

**If Party Struggles:**
- Reduce enemy numbers by 1
- Have reinforcements arrive late (PCs can escape)
- Rivals offer surrender earlier

**If Party Dominates:**
- Add 1-2 more enemies
- Enemies have better tactics
- Add environmental hazards (fire, collapsing building)

### **Moral Complexity Notes**

**This quest works because:**
- Baron isn't evil (controlling but loving)
- Thomas isn't perfect (idealistic but naive)
- Elara isn't naive (adult making informed choice)
- No one is lying (all three tell truth from their perspective)

**The conflict is VALUES, not good vs evil:**
- Family duty vs personal freedom
- Tradition vs love
- Security vs autonomy
- Father's protection vs daughter's agency

### **Player Agency**

**Respect all choices:**
- Working for Baron is valid (contract, money, order)
- Working for Thomas is valid (romance, freedom, right thing)
- Mediating is valid (peace, wisdom, creativity)
- Refusing is valid (no good option, stay neutral)

**Don't punish players for "wrong" choice because there isn't one.**

## 🎯 Quest 1.3: BLOOD MONEY

**Level:** 3  
**Duration:** 2-3 sessions  
**Objective:** Eliminate "bandit leader" terrorizing trade routes—or discover the truth  
**Key NPCs:** Elara Thornwood, Merchant Consortium Representatives, Captain Willem  
**Rewards:** 500gp (base), or 300gp + ally, or political power  
**Theme:** "One person's terrorist is another's freedom fighter"

### **Quest SETUP**

A week has passed since Quest 1.2. PCs have settled into guild life. Then Varak summons them with an unusual contract—high-paying, but there's something off about it.

**Read Aloud:**

> *Varak's office is unusually crowded. Three merchants in expensive clothing stand before his desk, arguing over a map. Behind them, a tall woman in armor—clearly military—listens with arms crossed. They all turn when you enter.*
>
> *The lead merchant—a portly man with gold rings on every finger—steps forward. His smile is oily, practiced.*
>
> *"Ah! The mercenaries! Excellent! We have a lucrative opportunity for competent professionals. Five hundred gold pieces to solve a problem that's been bleeding us dry for months. Interested?"*

**Varak'S Briefing:**

> *"High-paying contract. Merchant Consortium wants a bandit leader eliminated. This 'Red Wolf' has been hitting caravans for three months—stealing goods, disrupting trade. The consortium's tried hiring guards, doesn't work. They want the head of the snake cut off."*
>
> *He leans forward.*
>
> *"Before you ask—yes, I verified the contract. It's legitimate. The bandits ARE attacking caravans. People ARE getting hurt. This isn't a scam. But..."*
>
> *He pauses.*
>
> *"The pay is high. 500 gold for one bandit? That's suspicious. Either she's incredibly dangerous, or there's more to this story. Find out which before you commit."*

### **Client PRESENTATION**

**NPC: Merchant Lord Castor Goldweave**

*Medium humanoid (human), lawful evil (thinks he's lawful neutral)*

**Appearance:** 50s, overweight, gold rings, expensive silk clothing, oily smile, calculating eyes

**Personality:**
- Greedy but not stupid
- Sees people as profit margins
- Hides behind "legitimate business"
- Actually corrupt but legal
- Believes money justifies everything

**Stats:** Use **Noble** (CR 1/8), will never fight

**Castor's Pitch:**

> *"Gentlemen, ladies, let me explain the situation. For three months, a bandit calling herself 'Red Wolf' has terrorized the Thornwood trade route. She's stolen over 5,000 gold pieces worth of merchandise. Attacked twelve caravans. Three guards are dead.*
>
> *We've tried hiring more guards—she avoids them. We've tried negotiating—she refuses. We've tried going through legal channels—the local magistrate is... unhelpful.*
>
> *So we're hiring professionals to solve this permanently. Find her base. Kill her and her top lieutenants. Break the gang. We'll pay 500 gold pieces—250 upfront, 250 when we see her head.*
>
> *The Thornwood Forest is her territory. She strikes at night. She has maybe twenty bandits with her. Former soldiers, we think. Disciplined. Dangerous.*
>
> *Questions?"*

**If PCs ask questions:**

**"Why so much gold for one bandit?":** *"Because she's cost us ten times that! And she's organized—this isn't some desperate peasant. She's military-trained, tactical, effective. Worth the price to eliminate her."*

**"Who is she?":** *"Some disgraced noble, we hear. Calls herself 'Red Wolf' but rumors say her real name is Elara Thornwood—used to own the forest before... well, before she lost it."*

**"Lost it how?":** *"Legal disputes. Debts. Foreclosure. Not our concern—we bought the trade rights legally. But she apparently disagrees with the courts."*

**"What if she surrenders?":** *"We want her dead. She's a symbol now—other would-be bandits are watching. If she surrenders and walks away, we look weak. Make her disappear."*

**"What about her followers?":** *"Kill them, scare them off, we don't care. Just make sure Red Wolf doesn't come back."*

**Insight DC 14:** Castor is hiding something. He's nervous about PCs investigating too closely.

**Insight DC 18:** He specifically wants her dead quickly—before she can talk to authorities or make a public case.

### **The Military Advisor**

**NPC: Captain Willem Hartstone**

*Medium humanoid (human), lawful neutral*

**Appearance:** 40s, military bearing, scarred face, practical armor, weary eyes

**Personality:**
- Former soldier, now mercenary captain
- Works for merchants but uncomfortable with it
- Honor-bound but pragmatic
- Knows something is wrong but needs the money
- Will help PCs if approached right

**Stats:** Use **Veteran** (CR 3)

**If PCs approach Willem privately:**

> *Willem glances at the merchants to make sure they're not listening. He speaks quietly:*
>
> *"Look, I don't like this contract. But I need the money—my company is broke, and these merchants pay well. Just... be careful. This 'Red Wolf' isn't what they're telling you.*
>
> *I've fought her. Three times. She's former military—probably noble cavalry. She had training. And here's the thing: she doesn't kill unless cornered. She takes goods, lets merchants go. She's not a murderer.*
>
> *And her 'bandits'? They're not bandits. They're peasants. Former farmers from Thornwood lands. They follow her willingly.*
>
> *I don't know the whole story, but something isn't right. These merchants are hiding something. If I were you, I'd investigate before taking this contract at face value."*

**If PCs ask him to elaborate:**

*"Ten years ago, House Thornwood owned those forests—and the land, the villages, everything. Then the lord died. His heir—a young woman—suddenly had massive debts called in. The courts ruled against her. The land was auctioned. The Merchant Consortium bought it all for a fraction of its value.*

*The peasants said the debt was forged. Said the consortium bribed the judges. But who's going to believe peasants over merchants? House Thornwood lost everything. The girl vanished. Then, three months ago, 'Red Wolf' appeared.*

*You do the math."*

**Insight DC 12:** Willem is telling the truth. He genuinely believes the Thornwood family was cheated.

### **The Decision Point**

Varak interrupts before Willem can say more:

> *"Enough speculation. Here's the contract. Read it. Sign it or don't. But decide now—the merchants won't wait forever. And other mercenaries are interested."*

**The Contract:**

- **Client:** Merchant Consortium (Castor Goldweave, representative)
- **Target:** "Red Wolf" (real name possibly Elara Thornwood)
- **Objective:** Eliminate target and top lieutenants
- **Payment:** 500gp (250 upfront, 250 on proof of death)
- **Timeline:** 2 weeks maximum
- **Bonus:** +100gp if completed within 1 week

**Fine Print (Investigation DC 13 to notice):**
- "Contractor agrees to complete elimination without consulting local authorities"
- "Target must not be taken alive"
- "All evidence of target's death becomes property of client"

**If PCs point out the fine print:**

Castor smiles: *"Standard contract terms. We want proof of death—her head, or something identifiable. And we don't want local authorities involved because they're incompetent—that's why we're hiring you. Any other concerns?"*

**The Choice (Before Investigation):**

**Option 1: Accept Contract**
- Take 250gp upfront
- Hunt Red Wolf
- Complete as written

**Option 2: Refuse Contract**
- Walk away
- Someone else will take it
- Red Wolf's fate uncertain

**Option 3: Investigate First**
- Ask for time to scout the target
- Castor agrees (reluctantly)
- Gather more information before committing

**Option 4: Take Contract, Investigate Anyway**
- Accept upfront payment
- Hunt Red Wolf while investigating truth
- Decide based on what you learn

### **Investigation Phase**

**Smart PCs will investigate before committing. Several options:**

**Option A: Talk to Local Villagers**

Visit villages near Thornwood Forest (half-day travel).

**Read Aloud:**

> *The village of Oakshade sits at the forest's edge. Once prosperous, now it's withered—half the cottages empty, fields untended, people sullen. An old woman sits outside the tavern, watching you with suspicious eyes.*

**NPC: Old Mira** (Use Commoner stats)

If PCs buy her ale and talk:

> *"You're here about the bandits, aren't you? The merchants sent you. Of course they did. They always send people.*
>
> *Let me tell you about those 'bandits.' They're my neighbors. My friends. People I've known for thirty years. They worked these lands when House Thornwood owned them. Fair wages, good treatment, protection.*
>
> *Then the consortium came. New owners. They doubled rents. Cut wages. Took our tools as 'collateral.' Evicted families who couldn't pay. Twenty families—children included—forced off land they'd worked for generations.*
>
> *When Lady Elara—that's the 'Red Wolf'—came back, she didn't come to rob. She came to help. She takes from consortium caravans and gives to us. Food. Medicine. Tools. She's not a bandit. She's Robin Hood.*
>
> *But you don't care, do you? You'll kill her for gold, just like they paid you to. That's what mercenaries do."*

**If PCs probe deeper:**

*"House Thornwood was framed. Lord Thornwood died in hunting accident—suspicious, but no proof. His daughter Elara inherited. Then suddenly, documents appeared showing massive debts to the consortium. Debts no one had heard of.*

*The consortium called them in. Elara couldn't pay—nobody could, the numbers were impossible. The courts ruled for the consortium. Auction. Elara lost everything.*

*She fled. We thought she was dead. Then three months ago, she came back. But she came back as Red Wolf—and she's been taking back what was stolen, bit by bit."*

**Insight DC 11:** The old woman believes every word. This is her truth.

**Option B: Examine Legal Records**

Visit local magistrate's office (costs 10gp in bribes, Investigation DC 15).

**What You Find:**

- Lord Thornwood's death certificate (10 years ago, "hunting accident")
- Debt documents (signed by Lord Thornwood, dated 6 months before death)
- Foreclosure notice (debts called in immediately after death)
- Auction records (Merchant Consortium won all lots, suspiciously low bids)
- **Investigation DC 18:** The debt signatures are forgeries (ink doesn't match period, handwriting slightly off)

**Option C: Talk to Local Authorities**

Visit the magistrate who ruled on the case.

**NPC: Magistrate Aldric Reeve**

*Medium humanoid (human), neutral evil*

**Appearance:** 60s, pompous, clearly well-paid by someone, nervous when questioned

**Personality:**
- Corrupt but cowardly
- Was bribed to rule for consortium
- Fears exposure but too deep to back out
- Will lie until caught, then crumble

**If PCs question him about the case:**

> *"The case was straightforward. Lord Thornwood owed money. He died. The debt passed to his heir. She couldn't pay. The law is clear. Debts must be paid or assets seized. I ruled according to the law."*

**Intimidation DC 14 or Evidence of Forgery:**

He breaks down:

> *"Fine! FINE! Yes, the consortium paid me! 5,000 gold to rule in their favor! But the debt documents were already there—I just... ignored certain irregularities. I didn't forge anything! I just looked the other way!*
>
> *The consortium wanted the land. Thornwood wouldn't sell. So they created debt, called it in after the lord's convenient death, and took everything. But I didn't kill anyone! I just... processed paperwork!*
>
> *Please don't report this. They'll kill me if I talk. Or worse—I'll lose everything too. Just take your contract and go!"*

**The Truth Revealed:**

If PCs investigate thoroughly, they discover:

✅ Lord Thornwood was murdered (made to look like accident)  
✅ Debt documents were forged  
✅ Magistrate was bribed  
✅ Merchant Consortium stole Thornwood lands through fraud  
✅ Elara/Red Wolf is the legitimate heir  
✅ Her "bandits" are loyal peasants seeking justice  
✅ She only targets consortium goods (never kills unless forced)  
✅ She's trying to gather evidence to expose the conspiracy  

**The merchants want her dead before she can present her case publicly.**

## Branching Paths

### **Path A: Complete Contract AS Written**

**If PCs accept contract and hunt Red Wolf:**

**Phase 1: Finding the Camp**

Tracking Red Wolf requires Survival checks:

**Survival DC 15:** Find recent bandit activity (3 days old)  
**Survival DC 18:** Track to general area (within 5 miles)  
**Survival DC 20:** Find exact camp location

**Alternatives:**
- **Persuasion DC 14 with villagers:** They'll reveal location if PCs promise not to hurt civilians
- **Interrogate captured bandit:** They're loyal, DC 18 Intimidation to break
- **Follow a caravan as bait:** Red Wolf attacks, follow her back (Stealth DC 16 to remain undetected)

**The Bandit Camp**

**Read Aloud:**

> *Deep in Thornwood Forest, you find them. Not a bandit camp—a refugee settlement. Thirty people, mostly families. Children play near campfires. Women mend clothes. Men sharpen farming tools repurposed as weapons. This isn't a gang of criminals. It's a community in exile.*
>
> *In the center, a young woman addresses her people. Late 20s, red-haired, wearing practical leather armor and a wolf-pelt cloak. She speaks with authority but also compassion:*
>
> *"Food stores are low. We'll hit another caravan tomorrow—but remember the rules: No killing. Take only from consortium wagons. Let the drivers go unharmed. We're not murderers. We're survivors."*
>
> *Someone calls out: "What if they resist?"*
>
> *She pauses. "Then we run. We're not strong enough to fight mercenaries head-on. Not yet. Our strength is speed, surprise, and the fact that we're fighting for our homes. They're fighting for gold. Remember that difference."*
>
> *Then she sees you. Her hand goes to her sword.*

**NPC: Elara Thornwood / "RED WOLF"**

*Medium humanoid (human), chaotic good*

**Appearance:** Late 20s, red hair, wolf-pelt cloak, practical leather armor, noble bearing despite rough living, determined eyes

**Personality:**
- Noble training but hardened by loss
- Tactical and intelligent (former cavalry officer)
- Cares deeply for her people (former peasants)
- Wants justice, not revenge (though line is blurry)
- Will fight to death to protect her followers
- Would prefer peaceful solution but expects violence

**Stats:** Use **Knight** with modifications (CR 4)

**Combat Stats:**
- AC 18 (breastplate, shield)
- HP 70 (special, determination)
- Longsword +1 (heirloom)
- Leadership ability: Allies within 30 ft have advantage on saves vs fear

**Initial Confrontation:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *Red Wolf steps forward, hand on sword but not drawing yet. Her voice is clear, authoritative:*
>
> *"You're not merchants. You're too well-armed. The consortium sent you, didn't they? How much are they paying you to kill me? 500 gold? 1,000?"*
>
> *She looks at her people—families, children, elders. Then back at you.*
>
> *"These are my people. Farmers. Craftsmen. Children. Do they look like dangerous bandits to you? We take food and supplies from the consortium because they stole our LAND. Our HOMES. Our LIVES.*
>
> *I am Lady Elara Thornwood. My family owned these lands for six generations. The consortium murdered my father, forged debts, bribed judges, and stole everything. I came back to reclaim what's mine—not through lawyers who can be bought, but through action.*
>
> *So. You have a choice. You can complete your contract—attack a camp full of families and kill a woman fighting for her birthright. Or you can walk away and let us continue our fight against the real criminals.*
>
> *Choose carefully. Because if you attack, I'll defend my people. And some of you will die for the consortium's gold. Is that really worth it?"*

**The Choice - Combat or Talk:**

**Option 1: Attack Immediately**
- Elara and her people fight
- See Combat Encounter below
- Most "bandits" are non-combatants (flee)
- Only 6 trained fighters resist

**Option 2: Talk First**
- Elara will explain full story
- Shows evidence (forgery analysis, witness statements)
- Offers alternative solutions
- See negotiation paths below

**Option 3: Ambush at Night**
- Attack sleeping camp
- Easy victory but brutal
- Kill civilians or just fighters?
- Massive moral weight

**Option 4: Challenge Elara to Duel**
- One-on-one combat
- She accepts (to spare her people)
- Win = contract complete, people scatter
- Lose = you're captured or killed

### **Negotiation Paths**

**If PCs choose to talk:**

**Path A1: Switch Sides**

*"Help us instead. We can't pay 500 gold, but we can offer you something more valuable: justice. Help us expose the consortium. Present our evidence to the kingdom courts. Be heroes, not hired killers."*

**What she offers:**
- 300gp (all she has)
- Evidence of consortium fraud
- Testimony from villagers
- Magistrate's confession (if you got it)
- Political power (exposing corruption)
- Clear conscience

**What she asks:**
- Help gather more evidence
- Protect her while she presents case to kingdom courts
- Fight consortium's hired thugs
- Risk your reputation with wealthy clients

**Path A2: Negotiate Truce**

*"We'll stop attacking caravans if the consortium agrees to renegotiate land rights. You mediate. Both sides meet, neutral ground, you ensure fair dealing."*

**Persuasion DC 16 with Elara:** She agrees to temporary ceasefire  
**Persuasion DC 18 with Consortium:** They agree to meeting (planning ambush)

If meeting happens:
- Consortium sends assassins to kill Elara at "negotiation"
- PCs must decide: warn her or let it happen
- If warned, combat against assassins
- If not warned, Elara dies, you get paid but blood on hands

**Path A3: Fake Her Death**

*"Help me disappear. Give the consortium a body—someone already dead, burned beyond recognition. I'll take my people to Aethoria, start new life. They think I'm dead, they stop hunting me."*

**What's needed:**
- Find a body of similar build (grim but practical)
- Burn it with Elara's signature wolf pelt
- Present it as her corpse
- Convince consortium (Deception DC 16)

**Success:** 500gp, Elara escapes, everyone lives  
**Failure:** Consortium discovers ruse, sends assassins, Elara hunted forever

**Path A4: Trial by Combat (for the land)**

*"The old laws allow trial by combat for land disputes. Challenge the consortium's claim. I'll fight their champion. If I win, my claim is legitimate by law. Will you help me arrange this?"*

**Persuasion DC 18 with kingdom authorities:** They agree (rare but legal)  
**Consortium must provide champion:** They hire powerful mercenary (CR 6)

This becomes a legal, public duel:
- Win = Elara regains lands legally
- Lose = She dies, claim dismissed
- PCs can help her train, provide equipment, or even fight as her champion

---

### **Combat ENCOUNTER** (If Attacked)

**Defenders:**

**1x Lady Elara Thornwood** (Knight variant, CR 4)
- AC 18, HP 70
- Longsword +1: +7 to hit, 1d8+5 damage
- Leadership: Allies within 30 ft advantage on fear saves
- Second Wind: 1d10+8 HP once
- Rallying Cry: When she uses Second Wind, 3 allies gain 8 HP

**6x Thornwood Fighters** (Veterans of her father's guard)
- Use **Guard** stats (CR 1/8 each)
- Loyal to death
- Protect non-combatants first

**20x Non-Combatants** (Commoners, CR 0)
- Families, children, elderly
- Will flee if able
- Some will beg for mercy
- Killing them is optional (and monstrous)

**Tactics:**

**Elara's Strategy:**
- Fights defensively, buying time for non-combatants to flee
- Uses terrain (trees, cover)
- Calls for her people to run
- Focuses on strongest PC (perceived leader)
- Surrenders if below 15 HP and innocents are safe
- Fights to death if innocents threatened

**If PCs Kill Non-Combatants:**
- Elara goes berserk (rage: advantage on attacks, resistance to damage)
- Fighters fight to death, no surrender
- Villagers hear about it (reputation -5, you're baby killers)
- Even consortium is disgusted (you're monsters)

**If PCs Spare Non-Combatants:**
- Elara respects that (might surrender if beaten)
- Fighters might surrender if she orders it
- Villagers grateful (reputation +1, you have standards)

**If Elara is Defeated:**

> *She falls to her knees, bleeding, sword dropped. She looks up at you:*
>
> *"Do it. Kill me. Take your blood money. But know this—you didn't kill a bandit today. You killed the last hope these people had. The consortium wins. Corruption wins. And you helped it happen.*
>
> *I hope your gold keeps you warm at night. I hope it fills the void where your honor used to be."*

**The Final Choice:**
- Kill her (complete contract, 500gp, weight of murder)
- Spare her (break contract, lose money, gain unlikely ally)
- Capture her (turn her in, partial payment, she'll be executed legally)

---

### **Path B: REFUSE CONTRACT (Walk Away)**

**If PCs refuse to take the contract:**

Castor is furious:

> *"Fine! We'll find mercenaries with actual spines! Plenty of sellswords in Crossroads happy to earn 500 gold. You're missing out on the easiest money you'll ever see!"*

**What happens:**

**1 week later, PCs hear:**
- Another mercenary company took the contract
- They attacked the camp
- Red Wolf and 12 of her people are dead
- Survivors scattered into the forest
- Consortium is "pleased"
- The other mercenaries are drinking at the tavern, celebrating

**PCs can:**
- Do nothing (story ends, they live with knowing they could have helped)
- Confront the mercenaries (social encounter, possible fight)
- Hunt down survivors (try to help too late)
- Investigate and posthumously clear Thornwood name

**Consequence:** You walked away. Sometimes that's the right choice. Sometimes it isn't.

---

### **Path C: Expose The Consortium**

**If PCs gather evidence and present it:**

**Requirements:**
- Testimony from magistrate (confession)
- Forgery analysis (proof debts were fake)
- Witness statements (villagers)
- Elara's evidence (documents she's gathered)

**Where to present:**
- Kingdom courts in capital
- Public forum (risky—consortium has power)
- Regional governor (might be bribed too)

**Persuasion DC 16 to be heard:**  
**Evidence presented convincingly:**  

**Outcome: PUBLIC TRIAL**

> *The hearing lasts three days. Consortium lawyers argue. Elara presents evidence. You testify. The magistrate confesses (reluctantly). Villagers speak. The forgeries are examined.*
>
> *The judge deliberates. Finally:*
>
> *"This court finds that House Thornwood was defrauded. The debts were forged. The lands were stolen. Lady Elara Thornwood is the legitimate heir. The Merchant Consortium is ordered to return all Thornwood properties and pay restitution."*

**Result:**
- Elara regains her lands
- Consortium is fined 10,000gp
- Magistrate is stripped of office
- Castor Goldweave arrested for fraud

**Payment:**
- Consortium pays you nothing (you betrayed them)
- Elara pays you 300gp (all she has)
- Kingdom pays 200gp reward for exposing corruption
- **Total: 500gp** (same as contract, but with honor)

**Reputation:**
- +3 with common folk ("Heroes!")
- +2 with honest merchants
- -3 with Merchant Consortium
- -1 with corrupt officials
- Known as "Just" or "Corruption Fighters"

---

### **Path D: COMPLETE CONTRACT (Deliver Her Head)**

**If PCs kill Elara and deliver proof:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *You return to Crossroads. Castor Goldweave meets you at the guild hall, smiling when he sees the wolf pelt—stained with blood.*
>
> *"Excellent work! The Red Wolf is dead! Here—250 gold, as promised. Plus the bonus for completing it within the week. 600 gold total!"*
>
> *He's practically giddy.*
>
> *"You've done the entire region a service! Trade will flow freely again! Profits will soar! This calls for celebration!"*
>
> *Behind him, Varak watches you silently. His expression is unreadable. He knows what you did. He knows what it cost.*

**Payment:**
- 600gp total
- Consortium is thrilled

**Reputation:**
- +2 with Merchant Consortium (you're reliable killers)
- +1 with wealthy clients (proven track record)
- -3 with common folk (you killed their hero)
- -2 with honest authorities (you killed legitimate heir)
- Known as "Ruthless" or "Corporate Thugs"

**Lingering Consequences:**

**Villagers remember:**
- Thornwood families hate you
- Will not help you in future
- Some might hire assassins (desperate revenge)

**The Truth Spreads:**
- Within weeks, evidence of forgery surfaces
- Kingdom launches investigation (too late for Elara)
- Consortium members arrested
- You helped them get away with murder just long enough

**Moral Weight:**
- You killed a woman fighting for her family's justice
- You protected corrupt merchants
- You chose gold over righteousness
- That's the job. That's what mercenaries do.

**Varak'S Comment (Private):**

> *"You completed the contract. Legally, perfectly, exactly as hired. That's professionalism.*
>
> *But let me ask you something: How much is your soul worth? Because you just sold a piece of it for 600 gold. That's 600 gold per piece. You have many pieces left?*
>
> *I'm not judging. I've made the same trade. Many times. Just... know what you're trading, and for how much. Because one day you'll look in the mirror and not recognize the person looking back.*
>
> *Contract complete. Next job?"*

## 🎬 DM Guidance: QUEST 1.3

### **Key Themes**

1. **Moral Relativism:** Who's the criminal—the "bandit" or the "legitimate businessmen"?
2. **Justice vs Law:** Legal doesn't mean right, illegal doesn't mean wrong
3. **Class Warfare:** Rich vs poor, power vs principle
4. **The Cost of Principles:** Righteousness doesn't pay as well as ruthlessness

### **Running the Investigation**

**Don't Rush It:**
- Let players investigate thoroughly
- Reward creative information gathering
- Make the truth gradually clear
- Don't force a choice—let them discover

**Present Both Sides Fairly:**
- Consortium is legally right (owns deeds)
- Elara is morally right (was defrauded)
- Neither side is entirely innocent (people have died)
- Let players decide what matters more

### **The Moral Dilemma**

**This works because:**
- Elara is ACTUALLY being oppressed (not paranoid)
- Consortium ACTUALLY committed fraud (not misunderstood)
- But Elara IS breaking the law (regardless of reason)
- And people HAVE died (violence has consequences)
- There's no "clean" solution

**What players might debate:**
- "Is revenge justice?"
- "Do bad laws deserve to be followed?"
- "Is property theft okay if the property was stolen first?"
- "Are we mercenaries or moral arbiters?"

### **Combat Adjustments**

**If Party Struggles:**
- Reduce Thornwood fighters to 4
- Elara has 50 HP instead of 70
- Fighters surrender sooner

**If Party Dominates:**
- Add 2 more veteran fighters
- Elara has 90 HP
- She has magic item (Ring of Protection)

### **Non-Combat Resolution**

**Heavily reward players who find non-violent solutions:**
- Faking death is clever (give inspiration)
- Exposing corruption is heroic (reputation bonus)
- Trial by combat is dramatic (fun side quest)

### **The Weight of Choice**

**However players resolve this:**
- Show consequences (NPCs react)
- Track reputation changes
- Let them feel the weight
- Don't punish—just show impact

**If they killed Elara:**
- Don't shame them
- Show aftermath (refugees scattered, hope lost)
- Let them sit with that choice
- That's the campaign

**If they saved Elara:**
- Don't make it easy
- Consortium is angry
- You've made powerful enemies
- That's the campaign too

---

## 🎯 Quest 1.3: BLOOD MONEY

**Level:** 3  
**Duration:** 2-3 sessions  
**Objective:** Hunt down and eliminate a "bandit leader" terrorizing trade routes  
**Key NPCs:** Elara Thornwood, Merchant Consortium, Elara's Peasant Followers  
**Rewards:** 500gp (if completing contract), Variable based on choices  
**Location:** Thornwood Forest, 30 miles from Crossroads

### **Quest HOOK**

**Read Aloud:**

> *Varak summons you to his office. On his desk sits a contract sealed with multiple wax seals—expensive paper, official-looking. When you enter, he's reading it with unusual interest.*
>
> *"High-value contract just came in. Merchant Consortium—legitimate business alliance from three cities. They're offering 500 gold to eliminate a bandit problem. That's exceptional pay for your level. Which means it's dangerous, complicated, or both."*
>
> *He slides the contract across.*
>
> *"Target is 'Red Wolf'—bandit leader operating in Thornwood Forest. Been hitting merchant caravans for six months. Dozen successful raids, zero survivors who fought back. The Consortium wants her dead. Publicly. As an example. They're offering an extra 100 gold if you bring back her head."*
>
> *He leans back.*
>
> *"I'm recommending you for this. You've proven competent. But this isn't entry-level work. Red Wolf has a gang—estimates say 15-20 fighters. They know the forest. They're disciplined. This is your first real test. Interested?"*

### **The CONTRACT**

**Client:** Merchant Consortium (legitimate business alliance)  
**Target:** "Red Wolf" - bandit leader in Thornwood Forest  
**Payment:** 500gp for elimination, +100gp for bringing head  
**Deadline:** Two weeks  
**Terms:** "Target must be confirmed dead. Gang must be scattered or eliminated. Bring proof."

**If PCs investigate the contract (Investigation DC 12):**
- All legal language is proper
- Multiple merchant houses signed it
- Contract is legitimate, not a setup

**If PCs ask Varak questions:**

**"What do you know about Red Wolf?"**  
*"Not much. Uses that name as an alias. Female—that's confirmed. Good tactician. Hits fast, retreats faster. Never leaves survivors. Professional operation, not desperate criminals."*

**"Why don't the merchants hire an army?"**  
*"Politics. Thornwood sits between Thaldros and Aethoria territories—neither kingdom wants to send troops into disputed land. Creates diplomatic incidents. Cheaper to hire mercenaries. If you fail and die, no political fallout."*

**"What's our backup?"**  
*"None. You're it. The Consortium tried hiring local militia—they got ambushed, lost half their men, survivors refused to go back. You're attempt number three."*

**"Any intel on the gang?"**  
*"Here."* (Hands over report) *"Eyewitness accounts. Not much. Well-armed, well-trained, loyal to Red Wolf. That's unusual for bandits—loyalty usually bought with fear or gold. This crew seems... different. Motivated."*

### **Investigation Phase**

Before hunting Red Wolf, smart PCs will investigate. Multiple sources available:

#### **Merchant Consortium Headquarters**

**Location:** Millford (1 day travel from Crossroads)

**Read Aloud:**

> *The Consortium headquarters is an impressive stone building—guild hall meets fortress. Inside, clerks bustle about managing trade manifests. You're directed to the office of Guildmaster Henrik Voss.*
>
> *Voss is a portly man in expensive robes, fingers heavy with rings. He smiles when you enter—the smile of someone used to buying solutions.*
>
> *"Ah! The mercenaries! Excellent! Have you killed that bandit bitch yet?"*

**NPC: Guildmaster Henrik Voss**

*Medium humanoid (human), lawful evil*

**Appearance:** 50s, overweight, expensive clothing, multiple rings, calculating eyes

**Personality:**
- Greedy, entitled, sees people as commodities
- Genuinely afraid of Red Wolf (she's cost him money)
- Believes wealth = righteousness
- Will lie about anything convenient

**Stats:** Use Noble (CR 1/8), won't fight

**If PCs ask questions:**

**"Tell us about Red Wolf:"**  
*"Criminal scum! She's been hitting our caravans for six months! Twelve successful raids! We've lost 10,000 gold in cargo! She steals everything—textiles, spices, tools, even food shipments meant for cities!"*

**"Why does she hit your routes specifically?"**  
*"Because we're successful! Thieves always target those who have something worth stealing! It's harassment, pure and simple!"*

**"What happened to the lands she operates in?"**  
*"Thornwood? Used to belong to some minor noble family. House Thornwood or something. They lost it years ago—bad investments, debts, royal seizure. Sad story. Irrelevant. The land is Consortium property now. Legal and proper."*

**Investigation/Insight:**

**DC 13 Insight:** Voss is nervous about something beyond lost profits. He's worried about exposure.

**DC 15 Investigation (if searching office):** Find legal documents showing Consortium purchased "Thornwood Estate" from crown for remarkably low price (10,000gp for lands worth 100,000gp+). Dated 5 years ago.

**DC 18 Investigation (deeper search):** Find second set of documents—forged tax records showing House Thornwood "owed massive debts to crown." The debts were fabricated. This was a land grab using false legal documents.

**If PCs confront Voss with evidence:**

*"That's... that's all legal! Crown-approved! We followed proper procedures! If there were... irregularities... that's the crown's fault, not ours! We're victims here! That's why Red Wolf is targeting us—she's a thief and criminal!"*

**The Truth (PCs won't know yet):** Consortium bribed corrupt officials to create fake debts, seized Thornwood lands, evicted the noble family. Everything legal on paper, completely fraudulent in reality.

#### **Thornwood Village**

**Location:** Small village near the forest (half-day from Millford)

**Read Aloud:**

> *Thornwood village is... wrong. At first glance, it's a typical hamlet—thatched cottages, small farms, a well in the square. But something's off. The people are too quiet. When you pass, they watch with guarded expressions. Suspicious. Afraid. Not of you—of something else.*
>
> *An elderly woman sweeps her doorstep. When you approach, she stops. Looks at your weapons. Then meets your eyes with defiance born of fear.*
>
> *"You here to hunt the Wolf?"*

**NPC: Grandmother Petra**

*Medium humanoid (human), neutral good*

**Appearance:** 70s, weathered face, peasant clothing, steel in her eyes

**Personality:**
- Protective of village
- Knows the truth
- Won't volunteer information (protects Red Wolf)
- Will talk if persuaded or if PCs show they're not blindly following contract

**If PCs are openly carrying contract or mention merchants:**

*"Then you can leave. We don't help murderers."*

**If PCs try Persuasion or Insight:**

**DC 14 Persuasion:** *"We're not here to kill innocents. We want the truth. What's really happening?"*

**Success:**

> *She eyes you for a long moment. Then sighs.*
>
> *"The Wolf isn't a bandit. She's Lady Elara Thornwood. This was her family's land. The merchants—those vultures—they stole it. Bribed the crown, faked documents, evicted her family. Her father died of grief. Her mother followed a year later."*
>
> *"Elara didn't become a bandit. She became a rebel. Every caravan she hits? That's cargo bought with stolen wealth. Every 'stolen' shipment? Half goes to the poor, half funds her attempt to reclaim what's hers. She's not terrorizing trade—she's reclaiming stolen property."*
>
> *"You kill her, you kill the only person fighting for justice. You help the merchants, you help thieves. Choose wisely, sellsword."*

**If PCs ask about the villagers:**

*"We follow her. By choice. When the Consortium took the lands, they raised our rents, seized our harvests, treated us like slaves. Elara could have fled, started over somewhere else. She stayed. She fights for us. So we fight for her."*

**If PCs ask where to find Red Wolf:**

*"I won't tell you. But... if you go into Thornwood Forest, she'll find you. She knows everything that happens in these woods. If you're not here to murder her, say so. Loudly. Maybe she'll talk instead of shooting."*

### **The Forest - Entering Red Wolf'S Territory**

**Read Aloud:**

> *Thornwood Forest is ancient—massive oaks and pines that block out the sun. The merchant road cuts through it, wide enough for wagons but bordered by dense undergrowth. Perfect ambush terrain.*
>
> *You've been walking for an hour when you notice: too quiet. No birds. No small animals. You're being watched.*
>
> *Then you see them. Figures step from the trees—ten, fifteen, twenty armed men and women, bows drawn, arrows nocked. Not bandits. Too organized. They wear mismatched armor but carry themselves like soldiers.*
>
> *A woman steps forward. Mid-twenties, auburn hair tied back, leather armor worn but well-maintained. A longsword at her hip. Her eyes are hard, calculating. A leader.*
>
> *"You're the mercenaries the Consortium hired. I'd ask how I know, but my people saw you leaving Millford. Now here's your choice: turn around and leave, or die here. I'm giving you one chance because I'm not a murderer. But I will defend my land and my people."*

**NPC: Elara Thornwood / "RED WOLF"**

*Medium humanoid (human), chaotic good*

**Appearance:** 26 years old, auburn hair, green eyes, lean and scarred from forest living, carries herself like nobility despite rough clothing

**Personality:**
- Driven by justice (from her perspective)
- Willing to kill in defense, but not eager
- Protective of her followers (they're her people)
- Bitter about the system that destroyed her family
- Practical—knows she can't beat an army, so uses guerrilla tactics

**Stats:** Use **Bandit Captain** (CR 2) but with modifications:
- HP: 65 (10d8 + 20)
- AC: 16 (studded leather +1)
- Skills: Add History +4, Insight +5, Persuasion +5
- Equipment: Longsword +1, Longbow, studded leather +1

**Her Followers:** 20 **Bandits** (CR 1/8) and 5 **Veterans** (CR 3)
- Mix of former soldiers and loyal peasants
- Well-trained (Elara trained them)
- Loyal to the death (they believe in her cause)

### **The CONFRONTATION**

This scene can go multiple ways depending on PC approach:

#### **Approach 1: Immediate Combat**

If PCs attack without talking:

**Combat Encounter:**
- 1 Elara Thornwood (CR 2, enhanced)
- 5 Veterans (CR 3 each)
- 20 Bandits (CR 1/8 each)

**Total CR:** ~12 encounter (DEADLY for level 3 party)

**Tactics:**
- Elara calls for focused fire on spellcasters
- Veterans protect Elara
- Bandits use hit-and-run tactics
- If Elara drops below 20 HP, she calls retreat
- Forest terrain gives them advantage (they know every tree)
- They'll use guerrilla tactics—fall back, ambush, repeat

**If PCs Win:**
- Collect Elara's head (if they want the bonus 100gp)
- Loot bodies (200gp in mixed gear and coins)
- Return to Consortium, collect 500-600gp
- **Consequence:** Villagers hate you, you've killed rightful heir, Consortium thrilled
- **Reputation:** Ruthless, follows contracts above all

**If PCs Lose:**
- Elara captures survivors (she won't kill unconscious enemies)
- Takes their weapons, releases them at forest edge
- Warning: "Go back to Crossroads. Tell the Consortium the Wolf won't be hunted. Tell them to return what they stole or I'll burn every caravan they send."
- **Consequence:** Failed contract, reputation hit, lose deposit

#### **Approach 2: Negotiation**

If PCs try to talk:

**Persuasion DC 14:** "We want to hear your side before we make a decision."

**Success:**

> *Elara eyes you warily, then nods.*
>
> *"You want the truth? Fine. Here it is: Five years ago, my family owned this land. House Thornwood—minor nobility, but we were fair lords. We cared for our people."*
>
> *"Then the merchants came. Henrik Voss and his Consortium. They wanted our land—it's on a prime trade route. We refused to sell. So they fabricated debts. Bribed crown officials. Forged tax records. Made it look like we owed the kingdom 50,000 gold."*
>
> *"The crown seized our lands. 'Sold' them to the Consortium for a fraction of their value. My father tried to fight it legally. He died of a broken heart before the trial finished. My mother followed six months later."*
>
> *"I had nothing. My birthright stolen by legal theft. So I took it back—one caravan at a time. Every piece of cargo I 'steal' is property bought with wealth stolen from my family. I'm not a bandit. I'm reclaiming what's mine."*
>
> *She looks at you directly.*
>
> *"So here's your choice, mercenaries: Kill me and help thieves keep stolen land. Or help me get justice. Or walk away and let us settle this ourselves. But know what you're choosing."*

**If PCs ask for proof:**

*"I have the original land deeds. The real tax records—the ones before they were forged. Letters from my father to lawyers, showing the fabricated debts. All hidden in case I need them for a legal challenge."*

She can provide this evidence (Investigation DC 10 confirms it's legitimate).

### **The CHOICE**

**Option 1: Complete the Contract (Kill Elara)**
- Fight begins (as per Combat approach above)
- Collect 500-600gp from Consortium
- **Consequence:** 
  - Killed legitimate heir
  - Helped corrupt merchants
  - Villagers become enemies
  - Earned reputation as mercenary who follows contracts regardless of morality
  - Varak approves (contract honored)
- **Alignment:** Lawful Neutral or Evil (depending on motivation)

**Option 2: Switch Sides (Help Elara)**
- Break contract with Consortium
- Help Elara reclaim her lands legally or by force
- **Sub-options:**
  - Legal: Take evidence to authorities (DC 18 Persuasion, weeks of effort)
  - Force: Help her raid Consortium headquarters
  - Compromise: Negotiate settlement between parties
- **Consequence:**
  - Lose contract payment (500gp)
  - Gain Elara's friendship (+1 noble ally for Act II)
  - Consortium becomes enemy
  - Reputation hit with merchants
  - Varak is FURIOUS (broke contract)—you're expelled from guild unless you have very good explanation
- **Alignment:** Chaotic Good, "right over rules"

**Option 3: Broker a Deal**
- Persuasion DC 18: Convince both parties to settle
- Elara wants: Her title restored OR 50,000gp compensation OR Consortium exiled
- Consortium wants: Elara stops raids OR Elara leaves region OR Elara dead
- Finding middle ground: VERY DIFFICULT
- Possible compromise: Consortium pays Elara 25,000gp to go away, keeps land, Elara rebuilds elsewhere
- **Consequence:**
  - Both sides moderately satisfied
  - You get paid by both (250gp from each = 500gp total)
  - Reputation as mediator
  - Neither side loves you, but both respect you
- **Alignment:** True Neutral, pragmatic problem-solver

**Option 4: Play Both Sides**
- Fake Elara's death (Deception DC 16)
- Bring "proof" to Consortium (need convincing fake evidence)
- Elara goes into hiding, waits for heat to cool
- Collect 600gp from Consortium
- Elara pays you 200gp from her stolen wealth
- **Consequence:**
  - 800gp total profit
  - Very risky—if discovered, both sides want you dead
  - Reputation as clever but untrustworthy
  - Elara becomes hidden ally (might return in Act II)
- **Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral, opportunistic

**Option 5: Expose the Consortium Publicly**
- Take evidence to authorities (if operating in Thaldros territory)
- Public trial ensues (DC 16 Persuasion to get officials to care)
- Success: Consortium investigated, lands might be returned
- Failure: Officials are also corrupt, bury evidence
- **Consequence:**
  - No payment from Consortium (they're arrested or fleeing)
  - Elara rewards you with her remaining family treasures (worth 400gp)
  - Major reputation boost with common folk
  - Enemies in merchant and noble circles
  - Complicated with guild (broke contract for "moral reasons")
- **Alignment:** Lawful Good, systemic justice

**Option 6: Walk Away**
- Refuse to take either side
- Return contract to Varak uncompleted
- Tell both parties to handle it themselves
- **Consequence:**
  - No payment
  - No enemies made
  - Reputation as neutral/cowardly (depending on who's judging)
  - Varak is disappointed but understands (unusual situation)
  - Option to return later in campaign if situation unresolved
- **Alignment:** True Neutral, non-intervention

### **Special Option: Creative Solutions**

If PCs come up with creative solution not listed:

**Examples:**
- Hire Elara as consultant to hunt "herself" (she gets paid, Consortium thinks she's dead)
- Frame someone else as Red Wolf
- Help Elara raid merchant HQ for documents proving fraud
- Marry Elara to a PC (noble title restored through marriage?)
- etc.

**DM should reward creativity** with partial success and unique consequences.

### **Returning to VARAK**

Varak's response varies dramatically based on choice:

#### **If You Completed Contract:**

> *Varak counts out 500 gold.*
>
> *"Consortium confirmed the kill. Contract fulfilled. Good work."*
>
> *He pauses.*
>
> *"I'm hearing rumors about what you learned out there. About the land grab. The forged documents. The dispossessed noble. I assume you know the truth?"*
>
> *(If PCs confirm)*
>
> *"And you killed her anyway. Interesting. That's the business we're in—we don't judge the morality of contracts, just complete them. Some mercenaries can't handle that. You can. That's valuable. Ruthless, but valuable."*
>
> *(He slides a small iron ring across—a veteran guild member token)*
>
> *"You're moving up. But remember: reputation is everything. You're now known as someone who follows contracts no matter what. That opens doors with some clients. Closes them with others. Live with it."*

#### **If You Switched Sides:**

> *Varak's face is stone.*
>
> *"You broke a contract. You sided with the target against the client. That's grounds for expulsion—or execution, depending on how angry I am."*
>
> *(He leans forward)*
>
> *"But I've read the evidence Elara provided. The Consortium's land grab was fraud. Legally permitted fraud, but fraud nonetheless. You chose justice over contract. Idiotic, but I understand the impulse."*
>
> *(He sighs)*
>
> *"Here's your punishment: 30 days suspension from guild. No contracts, no guild services, no protection. You're on your own for a month. After that, you're back in—but your reputation is damaged. Half the merchants won't work with you. The other half will pay extra for your 'integrity.'"*
>
> *(He stands)*
>
> *"Learn this lesson: in this business, breaking a contract should cost you more than keeping it. You got off light because the client was fraudulent. Next time, you won't be so lucky."*

#### **If You Brokered A Deal:**

> *Varak actually smiles—rare.*
>
> *"You turned a blood feud into a settlement. Both parties walked away moderately satisfied. No one died. Everyone got something."*
>
> *(Counts out gold from both payments)*
>
> *"That's rare in this business. Most mercenaries are hammers—every problem is a nail. You used your head instead of your sword. That's the kind of thinking that makes you more than just muscle."*
>
> *(Slides contract across)*
>
> *"Private contract. One of my personal clients. They need a... delicate situation handled. Not combat. Negotiation. Blackmail. Subtle work. Pays triple normal rates. Interested? You've earned it."*

**This opens path to higher-tier contracts in Act II.**

#### **If You Played Both Sides:**

> *Varak eyes you carefully.*
>
> *"Consortium believes Red Wolf is dead. Red Wolf has vanished from the region. Both parties satisfied. Contract technically fulfilled."*
>
> *(Long pause)*
>
> *"I don't know what you actually did out there. I don't want to know. But I'm hearing whispers that Red Wolf might not be as dead as the Consortium thinks. If that's true, and they find out, they'll come after you. So will everyone you lied to."*
>
> *(He slides the payment across)*
>
> *"You're clever. Clever people either get rich or get dead. Usually both, in that order. Watch your back."*

### **Consequences For Act Ii**

Track the following based on choice:

**Allies Gained:**
- Elara Thornwood (if helped her) - noble ally, potential romance option

## Quest 1.3 - DM Guidance

### **Design Philosophy**

This quest is about **moral complexity in systems**:

**The Dilemma:**
- Elara is legitimately wronged (fraud victim)
- But she's also committed crimes (robbery, assault)
- Consortium legally owns the land (corrupt process, but legal)
- But their ownership is based on fraud
- **Who's right? Who's wrong? Both? Neither?**

**The Test:**
- Will PCs follow contracts blindly?
- Will they break contracts for "righteousness"?
- Can they find middle ground?
- Are they mercenaries or heroes?

### **Key DMing Points**

**1. Present Both Sides Fairly**

Don't make Consortium cartoonishly evil or Elara saintly:
- Consortium genuinely believes business is business
- Elara has killed people (guards who fought back)
- Both have blood on their hands
- Both have valid arguments

**2. Respect All Choices**

Every option in this quest is valid:
- Killing Elara for profit? Valid (mercenary thinking)
- Helping Elara? Valid (justice thinking)
- Staying neutral? Valid (self-preservation)
- Getting creative? Valid (problem-solving)

**3. Consequences Matter**

Whatever PCs choose has lasting effects:
- Break contract? Guild suspends you
- Kill Elara? Villagers remember
- Help Elara? Merchants remember
- Play both sides? Everyone remembers

**4. No Correct Answer**

This quest has no "right" choice, only consequences:
- Players should debate this
- Characters should have different opinions
- Party might split on decision
- That's the point

### **Difficulty Adjustments**

**If Party Struggling:**
- Reduce Elara's follower count (15 instead of 25)
- Give more obvious clues about the fraud
- Make Consortium more obviously evil
- Offer easier Persuasion DCs

**If Party Dominating:**
- Add more followers to Elara's force
- Make Consortium more sympathetic (they didn't know about fraud)
- Add time pressure (Consortium sends second mercenary team)
- Make consequences more severe

### **Roleplaying Elara**

Elara should be **complex, not simple**:

**She's not a victim:**
- She chose this path
- She's killed people
- She's a rebel, not a martyr

**She's not a villain:**
- She's fighting for justice
- She protects her people
- She's willing to talk before fighting

**She's human:**
- Tired of running
- Wants her home back
- Knows she might lose
- Appreciates honesty

**Key Dialogue Beats:**

*"I'm not asking you to be heroes. I'm asking you to not be murderers."*

*"You think I wanted this? I had a castle. A title. A future. The Consortium took that. So I took it back, one caravan at a time."*

*"Kill me if you want. But know what you're doing—you're helping rich men stay rich by killing the people they stole from."*

### **Common Player Questions**

**"Is there a legal solution?"**
Yes, but very difficult (DC 18+ checks, weeks of time, corrupt officials)

**"Can we blackmail the Consortium with evidence?"**
Absolutely! Creative solution rewarded.

**"What if we just take the evidence and sell it to highest bidder?"**
Chaotic Neutral option—both sides might pay to suppress it.

**"Can we take over the territory ourselves?"**
Technically yes, but requires army/resources PCs don't have at level 3.

### **This Quest Tests:**

- **Contract vs. Conscience** - What wins?
- **Profit vs. Principles** - Which matters more?
- **System vs. Justice** - Can legal be wrong?
- **Pragmatism vs. Idealism** - Where's the line?
