**Rewards:** 4,000gp + legendary cooperation  
**Theme:** "Old enemies, new allies"

---

## Quest Setup

**One month after Quest 3.2**

**Read Aloud:**

> *Emergency session. Neutral diplomatic hall. You're summoned urgently.*
>
> *Commander Dawnblade and Envoy Valen sit at same table—first time they've cooperated willingly since the treaty. Both look shaken.*
>
> *Dawnblade speaks first: "We have reports. Northern border. Unknown force. Not Thaldros. Not Aethoria. Not Unbound."*
>
> *Valen continues: "Three villages destroyed. Completely. No survivors. No demands. No explanation. Just... annihilation."*
>
> *(They slide reconnaissance reports across table)*
>
> *"Whatever this is, it's coming south. Toward both our kingdoms. We estimate... two weeks until it reaches our borders.*
>
> *"For the first time in 500 years, Thaldros and Aethoria must fight together. Or die separately."*

---

## The External Threat

**What's attacking:**

### **The DREADHOST**

**Origin:** Northern Wastes beyond known borders

**Composition:**
- **Undead Legion** (10,000+ reanimated soldiers)
- **Necromancer Lords** (6 powerful casters)
- **The Dread King** (CR 18 necromancer lich)
- **Purpose:** Conquest and conversion (turn living into undead)

**Background:**

400 years ago, during the Godsfall, an ambitious king tried to achieve immortality using forbidden necromancy. Succeeded—became lich. Kingdom fell, all citizens converted to undead. For centuries, isolated in frozen north.

Now: Moving south. Need fresh corpses. Plan to convert both kingdoms.

**This is existential threat requiring unity.**

---

## The Intelligence

**Reconnaissance reports:**

**Read Aloud (From Reports):**

> *"Village of Northholm: Population 200. Found every citizen dead, reanimated within hours. Witnesses from nearby—before they fled—describe: 'Dead army. Thousands. Led by corpse-wizards in black robes. And at the rear... something ancient. Wearing crown of bone. The Dread King.'*
>
> *"Villages of Frostmere and Ironwood: Same fate. Total conversion. Undead population now estimated 10,600 and growing with each conquest.*
>
> *"Rate of advance: 30 miles per week. ETA to our borders: 14 days. ETA to capitals: 30-40 days."*

**Military assessment:**

> *"Thaldros military: 8,000 soldiers. Aethoria military: 6,000. Combined: 14,000.*
>
> *"Enemy forces: 10,600 undead (growing daily). Plus necromantic magic. Plus lich leadership.*
>
> *"Assessment: We're outnumbered. And our dead become their reinforcements. Without cooperation, we lose. Even with cooperation... uncertain."*

---

## Phase 1: Forge The Alliance

**PCs must unite the kingdoms:**

### **The Political Challenge**

**Problem:** Both kingdoms technically cooperating, but:
- Commanders don't trust each other
- Soldiers refuse to fight alongside "enemy"
- Logistics nightmare (different supply chains)
- Cultural differences (monarchy vs democracy)
- Old hatreds die hard

**PCs' Role:** Make it actually work

---

### **Challenge 1: Unified Command**

**Who commands combined army?**

**The Debate:**

**Thaldros Position (Dawnblade):**
> *"Unified command requires clear hierarchy. Thaldros has more experienced generals, better logistics, established chain of command. I should lead."*

**Aethoria Position (Valen):**
> *"Democracy means equal partnership. Joint command or no deal. We won't submit to monarchy's authority just because there's a crisis."*

**Both have valid points. Both refuse to budge.**

---

**PCs must mediate:**

**Option 1: Support Thaldros Command**
- **Persuasion DC 18** to convince Aethoria
- Argument: "Experience matters. Now's not time for democracy."
- If successful: Unified command under Dawnblade
- Consequence: Aethoria resentful but complies

**Option 2: Support Joint Command**
- **Persuasion DC 16** (easier, fair compromise)
- Argument: "Both contribute equally, both command equally."
- If successful: War council system
- Consequence: Slower decisions but better morale

**Option 3: Suggest Third-Party Command**
- **Persuasion DC 20** (bold)
- Argument: "Neither side leads. We—the Peacekeepers—command."
- If successful: PCs become Supreme Commanders
- Consequence: Ultimate responsibility falls on you

**Option 4: Split Forces**
- Let each kingdom fight independently
- Coordinate loosely
- Easier politically
- **Terrible strategically** (lich will defeat them separately)

---

### **Challenge 2: Troop Integration**

**How to make enemies fight together?**

**The Problem:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *The war camp is divided. Thaldros soldiers on west side. Aethoria militia on east. They avoid each other. Refuse to share supplies. Three fights broke out yesterday over who gets better tents.*
>
> *Officers report: Morale low. Soldiers don't want to die for "the enemy." Some considering desertion.*

---

**PCs must build unity:**

**Option 1: Joint Training Exercise**
- Force soldiers to drill together
- **Performance DC 16** (lead by example)
- Success: Grudging respect forms
- Time: 3 days

**Option 2: Shared Threat Reminder**
- Show them what they're fighting (bring undead prisoner OR testimonies from survivors)
- **Persuasion DC 15**
- Success: Fear overrides hatred
- Time: 1 day

**Option 3: Cultural Exchange**
- Organize joint meals, songs, storytelling
- **Persuasion DC 17**
- Success: Humanize each other
- Time: 5 days

**Option 4: Nothing**
- Let them stay divided
- They'll cooperate under fire (maybe)
- Risk: They might not

---

### **Challenge 3: Resource Allocation**

**Who gets limited resources?**

**The Scarcity:**
- Only 500 healing potions (need 1,000+)
- Only 100 magic weapons (undead resistant to normal)
- Only 50 clerics (Turn Undead is critical)

**Both sides want priority. PCs decide:**

**Option 1: Equal Split**
- Fair but insufficient for both
- Neither side satisfied but can't complain
- **Persuasion DC 14**

**Option 2: Merit-Based**
- Best units get priority
- Actually strategic
- Angers weaker units
- **Persuasion DC 17**

**Option 3: Front-Line Priority**
- Those facing worst danger get resources
- Makes sense tactically
- Morale boost for those chosen
- **Persuasion DC 15**

---

## Phase 2: The First Battle

**One week later. The Dreadhost arrives.**

### **The BATTLEFIELD**

**Location:** The Judgment Border (where war almost happened)

**Irony:** The place where you prevented war... now hosts battle to save both kingdoms.

**Read Aloud:**

> *Dawn. The Judgment Border. Your combined army: 14,000 living soldiers. Arrayed in defensive formation. Trenches. Stakes. Prepared positions.*
>
> *Then you see them. Cresting the northern hills. The Dreadhost.*
>
> *Row after row of undead. Thousands. Silent except for bone-rattle and armor-clank. No battle cries. No fear. No hesitation.*
>
> *At the rear: Six figures in black robes radiating necrotic energy. The Necromancer Lords.*
>
> *And beyond them: A palanquin carried by zombie ogres. On it sits: The Dread King. Ancient. Skeletal. Crown of bone. Lich.*
>
> *This is it. The battle for survival.*

---

### **The Battle Structure**

**This is large-scale battle. Don't run every soldier.**

**Abstract using three phases:**

---

**Battle Phase 1: The First Wave**

**Dreadhost sends forward 2,000 zombies:**

**PCs' Role:** Hold the center line

**Encounter:**

**40 Zombies** (CR 1/4, abstracted—PCs fight 40, represent larger battle)  
**4 Wights** (CR 3, squad leaders)  
**1 Death Knight** (CR 8, wave commander)

**Tactics:**
- Zombies mindlessly charge
- Wights command them
- Death Knight hangs back, eliminates strong defenders

**Allied Forces:** Handle rest of wave (abstracted)

**If PCs hold line:** First wave repelled, 200 allied casualties  
**If PCs fail:** Line breaks, 500 casualties, bad morale

---

**Battle Phase 2: Necromantic Assault**

**Necromancer Lords begin raising fallen:**

**The Horror:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *Your dead begin rising. Allied soldiers—killed minutes ago—stand up. Eyes vacant. They attack their former comrades.*
>
> *Morale plummets. Soldiers panic: "We're losing even when we win! Every death makes them stronger!"*
>
> *Someone needs to stop the necromancers.*

---

**PCs' Role:** Counter-battery mission

**Options:**

**Option A: Direct Assault**
- Charge necromancer lines
- Fight through undead to reach casters
- Very dangerous
- 2 encounters (undead screen + necromancers)

**Option B: Aerial Approach**
- Fly over battle (if PCs have flight)
- Bypass undead
- Surprise necromancers
- 1 encounter (necromancers only)

**Option C: Clerical Strike**
- Lead 50 clerics in Turn Undead wave
- Clear path to necromancers
- Religion DC 16 to coordinate
- Success: Path cleared, 1 encounter (necromancers)

---

**Encounter:**

**2 Necromancer Lords** (CR 12 each)

**Use Lich stats but weaker:**

**AC:** 17 | **HP:** 150 each | **Speed:** 30 ft.

**Spellcasting (DC 17, +9 to hit):**

**At will:** *ray of frost, chill touch*  
**3/day:** *animate dead, blight, dimension door*  
**2/day:** *circle of death, cloudkill*  
**1/day:** *finger of death, power word pain*

**Legendary Actions (2 per lord):**
- Cast cantrip
- Animate dead (raises 1d4 zombies nearby)
- Necrotic Burst (20-ft radius, 3d8 necrotic, DC 17 Con save half)

**If both killed:** Allied dead stop rising. Major morale boost.

---

**Battle Phase 3: The Dread King Attacks**

**Lich enters battle personally:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *The palanquin lowers. The Dread King stands. Ancient robes. Bone crown. Eyes glowing with centuries of hatred.*
>
> *He raises skeletal hands. Speaks one word in a dead language.*
>
> *TERROR.*
>
> *Every soldier on battlefield must make DC 18 Wisdom save or flee in panic. Your combined army is routing.*
>
> *Only you—heroes of legend—resist. You and maybe a dozen other veterans.*
>
> *The Dread King points at you. Recognizes threats. Advances.*

---

**Boss Fight Preview:**

**Don't fight him yet.** He's CR 18. PCs are 13. They'll lose.

**Instead:**

**PCs must:**
- Rally troops (Persuasion/Performance DC 18)
- Hold the line (survive 3 rounds against Dread King's attacks)
- Buy time for commanders to organize retreat

**The Dread King attacks from range:**
- **Finger of Death** (7d8 + 30 necrotic, DC 18 Con save half)
- **Power Word Kill** (if any PC below 100 HP, they die)
- **Animate Army** (all fallen soldiers rise as zombies)

**PCs must survive 3 rounds. Then:**

**Dawnblade + Valen arrive with elite guards:**

> *"FALL BACK! Organized retreat! We can't win here!"*

**Allied army retreats. Loses 2,000 soldiers but survives.**

**Dread King doesn't pursue. He's patient. Converts fallen to undead. Now has 12,600 troops.**

---

## Phase 3: The Counter-Strategy

**War council, that night:**

### **The Strategic Situation**

**Grim facts:**
- Lost first battle
- Enemy stronger (gained 2,000 undead)
- Morale shattered
- Can't win conventional war

**Dawnblade:** "We need new strategy."  
**Valen:** "Agreed. But what?"

---

**PCs can suggest strategies:**

**Strategy A: Decapitation Strike**
- Kill the Dread King, horde collapses
- High-risk, high-reward
- Requires small team (PCs) infiltrating enemy
- 90% chance of success vs guaranteed slow loss

**Strategy B: Scorched Earth**
- Retreat, burn everything, deny corpses
- Slow enemy advance
- Buys time but costs civilian lives
- Eventually run out of land

**Strategy C: Divine Intervention**
- Seek help from temples, gods, powerful beings
- Time-consuming (1 week to gather)
- Uncertain (will gods help?)
- But potentially game-changing

**Strategy D: Alliance with Third Party**
- Seek help from: Dwarven kingdoms? Elven forests? Others?
- Diplomatic mission
- Takes time
- Might work

**Strategy E: Magical Solution**
- Research anti-undead weapon/spell
- Scholars, wizards, libraries
- Takes 1 week
- Might find something

---

**DM Guidance:** Strategy A (Decapitation) is meant to be chosen. It leads to climax.

---

## Chosen Strategy: Decapitation Strike

**If PCs choose to kill the Dread King:**

### **The Plan**

**Dawnblade:** "Small team. Infiltrate enemy camp. Kill the lich. Without him, the horde loses cohesion."

**Valen:** "It's a suicide mission."

**PCs:** "We'll do it."

**Preparation:**

PCs can recruit up to 4 NPC allies from:
- Dawnblade herself (if she trusts them)
- Valen himself (if he's brave enough)
- Iron Guild mercenaries (Varak if alive)
- Black Chains fighters (Kael if alive)
- Marcus Blackwood (if alive from Quest 1.5)
- Red Wolf (if alive from Quest 1.3)
- Any other major ally from previous quests

**Each ally provides unique benefit:**
- Dawnblade: Tank, paladin support
- Valen: Control magic, inspiration
- Varak: Tanking, dwarf resilience
- Kael: DPS, ruthless tactics
- Marcus: Intelligence, tactical advice
- Red Wolf: Stealth, guerrilla tactics

---

### **The Infiltration**

**Night. Behind enemy lines:**

**Three obstacles:**

**Obstacle 1: Undead Patrols**
- **Stealth DC 17** (group check) to avoid 100+ zombies
- Failure: Combat with 20 zombies + 2 wights
- Success: Bypass undetected

**Obstacle 2: Necromantic Wards**
- **Arcana DC 18** to dispel alarm wards
- Failure: Necromancer Lords alerted (harder boss fight)
- Success: Approach undetected

**Obstacle 3: Inner Sanctum**
- Dread King's tent/throne room
- 6 **Skeleton Champions** guard (CR 3 each)
- Must fight (can't stealth past these)

---

## Final Boss: The Dread King

**In his sanctum:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *The Dread King sits on throne of skulls. Ancient lich. Crown of bone. Staff of dark crystal. Eyes that have seen centuries.*
>
> *He doesn't rise. Doesn't seem surprised.*
>
> *"Ah. Heroes. Come to slay the monster. How... predictable."*
>
> *(His voice is dry, ancient, amused)*
>
> *"I conquered death itself. You think you can kill me? Amusing. Very well. Entertain me before you join my legion."*
