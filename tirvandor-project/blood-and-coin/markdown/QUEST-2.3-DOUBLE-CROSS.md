---

---

## The Revelation

**Session begins normally. Then:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *You're returning to your lodgings after another successful mission. Gold in hand, reputation solid. You're becoming important players in this war.*
>
> *Then you find it: an envelope slipped under your door. No seal. No signature. Just a note:*
>
> *"They're lying to you. They've been lying from the start. Meet me at the Old Mill, midnight. Come alone. I have proof. —A Friend"*
>
> *Attached: a single document. It looks official. And damning.*

**The document varies by faction...**

# 🏰 IF Working For Thaldros

## The Document

**Royal Military Memo (appears authentic):**

> **FROM:** Royal Command  
> **TO:** Commander Dawnblade  
> **RE:** Mercenary Operations—Asset Disposal  
> 
> *Approved contractors [your group name] have performed adequately. Continue utilizing for sensitive operations through war's end.*
>
> *Post-conflict: Initiate Protocol Scapegoat. Frame contractors for documented atrocities (Thornwood Convoy, civilian casualties, etc.). Public trial. Execution.*
>
> *Rationale: Crown maintains clean image. Mercenaries bear responsibility for necessary wartime actions. Loose ends eliminated.*
>
> *Authorization: King's Seal*

**Investigation DC 14:** Document appears genuine (royal watermarks, proper formatting, real signatures)

---

## The Meeting

**Old Mill, Midnight**

**If PCs attend:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *The Old Mill is abandoned, dark, perfect for clandestine meetings. You arrive carefully, weapons ready.*
>
> *A figure emerges from shadows—cloaked, face hidden. Female voice, low and urgent:*
>
> *"You came. Good. You're smarter than most." She tosses you a leather folder. "More proof. Orders. Correspondence. They're planning to execute you. Make you martyrs. Pin everything on 'rogue mercenaries' while the crown stays pure."*

**The folder contains:**
- 12 more documents (authentic)
- Execution orders pre-signed
- Lists of "mercenary crimes" to publicize
- Timeline: arrest you 3 days after war ends

## Npc: The Informant (Captain Sarah Vale)

**Appearance:** 30s, royal military uniform under cloak, blonde hair, haunted eyes, guilty expression

**Who She Is:**

- Risking execution to warn you

**Armor Class:** 16 (breastplate)  
**Hit Points:** 58 (9d8 + 18)  
**Speed:** 30 ft.

**STR** 15 (+2) | **DEX** 14 (+2) | **CON** 14 (+2)  
**INT** 12 (+1) | **WIS** 13 (+1) | **CHA** 14 (+2)

**Senses:** Passive Perception 14  
**Languages:** Common  
**Challenge:** 3 (700 XP)

**Combat Veteran.** Advantage on saves vs fear.

**Second Wind (Recharge 5-6).** Heal 1d10 + 9 as bonus action.

#### Actions

**Multiattack.** Two longsword attacks.

**Longsword.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
*Hit:* 6 (1d8 + 2) slashing damage.

**Heavy Crossbow.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target.  
*Hit:* 7 (1d10 + 2) piercing damage.

#### Personality

**Motivation:**
- Can't stomach executing honorable mercenaries
- Seen too much corruption in crown
- This was final straw
- Willing to defect if you'll have her

**What She Knows:**
- Scapegoat Protocol is real
- Dawnblade is conflicted but will follow orders
- Crown has done this before (you're not first)
- War's end is 2-3 months away (timeline urgent)

**What She Wants:**

- Maybe defect with you
- Prevent injustice
- Doesn't expect to survive this

---

### **Confrontation With Dawnblade**

**If PCs confront her with evidence:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *You storm into Dawnblade's office, documents in hand. She looks up, sees what you're holding, and her face falls.*
>
> *"Ah." She stands slowly. "Sarah. I should have watched her more closely."*
>
> *She doesn't deny it. Doesn't even try.*
>
> *"Yes. It's real. Scapegoat Protocol. Orders from high command. When the war ends, you'll be arrested. Tried for war crimes. Executed. The crown needs someone to blame, and mercenaries are perfect."*

**Insight DC 12:** She's deeply uncomfortable but resigned to following orders

**If PCs get angry:**

> *"You think I LIKE this? I'm a soldier. I follow orders. Even orders I hate. That's the oath I took. That's the burden I bear."*
>
> *(Her voice cracks slightly)*
>
> *"For what it's worth... you're good people. You did the dirty work no one else would do. And yes, you'll die for it. That's the price of serving power. I'm sorry."*

**If PCs threaten her:**

> *"Kill me if you want. Won't change anything. Scapegoat Protocol is official. My replacement will execute it. You can't fight the entire kingdom."*

---

### **The CHOICE (Thaldros Path)**

**PCs must decide:**

#### **Option 1: FLEE THALDROS**

**Actions:**
- Abandon faction immediately
- Become fugitives
- Find new employer or go independent

**Consequences:**
- Wanted by entire Thaldros military
- Bounty: 5,000gp (dead or alive)
- Lose all Thaldros connections
- Can't return to kingdom-controlled areas
- Sarah defects with you (if you let her)
- Survive but hunted

---

#### **Option 2: SWITCH TO AETHORIA**

**Actions:**
- Contact Envoy Valen
- Offer to defect with intelligence
- Join Aethoria cause

**Envoy Valen's Response:**
> *"Thaldros betrayed you? I'm not surprised. They devour their own. Join us. We'll protect you. Plus, your intelligence on Thaldros operations is invaluable. Welcome to the Republic."*

**Consequences:**
- Aethoria pays 2,000gp for defection + intelligence
- Reputation: +10 with Aethoria
- Reputation: -20 with Thaldros (traitors)
- Now working for opposite side
- War continues, you've switched teams

---

#### **Option 3: BLACKMAIL THALDROS**

**Intimidation DC 18 to make Dawnblade back down:**

**If successful:**
> *"You want to negotiate? Fine. I'll report Scapegoat Protocol 'failed' due to security leak. You'll be marked as liabilities instead of assets. They won't actively hunt you, but they won't protect you either. You'll be on your own. Deal?"*

**Consequences:**
- Thaldros backs off (you're too risky to arrest)
- No payment, no support, no protection
- Technically independent
- Can work for anyone now
- Thaldros watches you but doesn't attack
- Uneasy truce

---

#### **Option 4: ACCEPT FATE**

**Decide to stay loyal despite betrayal:**

**Why PCs might choose this:**
- Believe in Thaldros cause despite corruption
- Pragmatic acceptance of mercenary risks
- Too invested to quit
- Think they can survive trial somehow

**Consequences:**
- Continue working for Thaldros
- Know you'll be arrested when war ends
- Try to gather evidence to exonerate selves
- Or plan escape for later
- Living on borrowed time

---

#### **Option 5: GO ROGUE**

**Kill Dawnblade, expose Scapegoat Protocol publicly:**

**If you kill her:**
- Immediate alarm
- 20 **Thaldros Guards** respond (CR 1/8 each)
- Must fight way out or die

**If you expose protocol:**
- Publish documents to press/public
- Major scandal for crown
- Some nobles support you, others hunt you
- Public opinion divided
- Crown furious but can't openly retaliate

**Consequences:**
- Massive political fallout
- Thaldros government embarrassed
- You're heroes to some, traitors to others
- Can't work in Thaldros territory
- Crown sends assassins privately

# 🗽 IF Working For Aethoria

## The Document

**Senate Internal Memo (appears authentic):**

> **FROM:** Senator Council Leadership  
> **TO:** Envoy Valen  
> **RE:** Post-War Governance Structure  
>
> *Once victory secured, initiate Phase Two: Democratic Consolidation.*
>
> *Translation: Suspend elections "temporarily." Establish emergency council of senators (us). Grant ourselves extraordinary powers "until stability restored."*
>
> *We fought for democracy. We'll rule through democracy. Just... guided democracy. The people aren't ready for full self-governance. They need strong leaders.*
>
> *Valen: Your mercenaries have served well. After victory, they know too much. Offer them command positions in remote territories. Keep them busy. If they refuse, frame as Thaldros collaborators. Trial. Exile.*
>
> *The revolution must be protected. Even from those who fought for it.*

**Investigation DC 15:** Document appears genuine (senate seals, authentic signatures)

---

## The Meeting

**Old Mill, Midnight**

**The Informant:** **marcus thorne** (the defector from Quest 2.2, if he survived)

**If Thorne died in Quest 2.2, use different informant:**

**Alternative: JULIA REDWIND** (Aethoria intelligence officer, similar stats to Sarah Vale)

**Thorne'S Revelation:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *General Marcus Thorne stands in the shadows. He looks even more haunted than before.*
>
> *"I defected from Thaldros because I saw what tyranny does. Now I'm watching Aethoria become the same thing. Different name. Same poison.*
>
> *(He hands you documents)*
>
> *"The senate leadership—not all, but enough—they're planning a coup. Democracy was always a tool. Once they win the war, they'll suspend elections. Rule as oligarchs. Everything we fought for... a lie.*
>
> *And you? You're too dangerous. You know too much. They'll either exile you or frame you as traitors. I've seen this pattern before. I helped Thaldros do it."*

---

### **Confrontation With Valen**

**If PCs confront him:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *Valen looks at the documents. His face falls. He sits heavily.*
>
> *"It's true." His voice is quiet, defeated. "Not me—I genuinely believe in democracy. But the senate leadership... yes. They plan to consolidate power after the war.*
>
> *(He looks at you, eyes pleading)*
>
> *"But don't you see? We're fighting Thaldros tyranny. If we don't have strong leadership during the transition, everything falls apart. Maybe... maybe temporary emergency powers are necessary. Just until stability—"*
>
> *(He stops, hearing himself)*
>
> *"Gods. I sound like them. I'm making excuses for tyranny."*

**Insight DC 13:** Valen is genuinely conflicted—he really believes in democracy but has rationalized compromise

**If PCs press him:**

> *"You want the truth? I KNEW. I knew some senators had this plan. I told myself it wouldn't happen. That we'd stop it after victory. That democracy would prevail.*
>
> *But I also knew that if I opposed them openly, I'd be removed. Replaced with someone worse. So I... cooperated. Kept my head down. Told myself I was being pragmatic.*
>
> *(Ashamed)*
>
> *I'm a hypocrite. I fought for democracy while enabling its betrayal. You deserved better."*

---

### **The CHOICE (Aethoria Path)**

**PCs must decide:**

#### **Option 1: FLEE AETHORIA**

**Actions:**
- Leave Republic immediately
- Become independent
- Avoid both kingdoms

**Consequences:**

---

#### **Option 2: SWITCH TO THALDROS**

**Actions:**
- Contact Commander Dawnblade
- Offer intelligence on Aethoria
- Join monarchy

**Dawnblade's Response:**
> *"Aethoria betrayed you? Democracy always fails. Welcome to the side of order. We'll pay well for your intelligence. 3,000 gold. Plus, when we win, you'll be rewarded properly."*

**Consequences:**
- Thaldros pays 3,000gp for defection
- Reputation: +10 with Thaldros
- Reputation: -20 with Aethoria (traitors)
- Irony: fought for freedom, joined tyranny
- But at least tyranny is honest about being tyranny

---

#### **Option 3: SAVE DEMOCRACY**

**Work with Valen to expose corrupt senators:**

**Persuasion DC 16 to convince Valen to help:**

**If successful:**
> *"You're right. If democracy is worth fighting for, it's worth fighting for HONESTLY. Help me. We'll expose the corrupt senators. Force public trials. Restore true democracy. It's risky—they'll try to kill us—but it's RIGHT."*

**The Campaign:**
- Gather more evidence (3 skill challenges)
- Build coalition of honest senators (social encounters)
- Public reveal at senate session (dramatic scene)
- Face political assassination attempts (2 combat encounters)

**If successful:**
- Corrupt senators removed
- Democracy preserved
- You're heroes of the TRUE revolution

---

#### **Option 4: ACCEPT OLIGARCHY**

**Decide corrupt senate is better than Thaldros:**

**Rationalization:**
- "Guided democracy" is still better than monarchy
- Pragmatic acceptance
- Lesser evil
- At least they'll rule competently

**Consequences:**
- Continue working for Aethoria
- Know democracy is dying
- Help establish oligarchy
- Payment continues but conscience damaged
- Become tools of hypocrisy

---

#### **Option 5: ANARCHIST REVOLUTION**

**Burn it all down—expose both kingdoms:**

**Actions:**
- Leak corruption evidence publicly
- Reveal Thaldros Scapegoat Protocol too
- Undermine both governments
- Create power vacuum

**Consequences:**
- Both kingdoms destabilized
- Chaos spreads
- You're wanted by EVERYONE
- Common folk divided (some support, some blame you)
- Unbound (Corvus) sees opportunity
- You've started regional collapse

---

# 🔥 IF Working For The Unbound

## The Document

**Corvus's Private Journal (stolen pages):**

> **Journal Entry—Month 7**
>
> *The Components' power is intoxicating. Two secured. Three remain. Soon.*
>
> *Initial calculations: restructuring will cause 30-40% population casualties. Acceptable cost for perfect world. Mercenaries don't need to know exact numbers. Tell them "some" will die. They're mercenaries—pragmatic.*
>
> **Month 9**
>
> *Proximity to Components affecting my judgment? No. I'm thinking more clearly than ever. The old world MUST burn. All of it.*
>
> *If mercenaries refuse final phase, eliminate them. Too dangerous to leave alive. They know too much about Components' locations.*
>
> **Month 11**
>
> *Final restructuring will remove free will. Only way to ensure perfection. Humans make wrong choices. We'll make choices FOR them. They'll thank us eventually. Or... they won't be capable of dissent anymore.*
>
> *Is this evil? No. It's necessity. I'm saving humanity by making them something better. Something controlled.*

**Investigation DC 14:** Handwriting matches Corvus's other documents (authentic)

### **Confrontation With Corvus**

**If PCs confront him:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *Corvus looks at the journal pages. His expression shifts—not shame, but annoyance.*
>
> *"Elara. Always too sentimental." He looks at you calmly. "Yes. It's all true. 30-40% casualties. Free will removal. Necessary steps for perfect world.*
>
> *(He's not apologetic. He's EXPLAINING.)*
>
> *"You're mercenaries. You understand hard choices. Sometimes you must kill to save. This is that, scaled up. Kill millions to save billions.*
>
> *The old world is BROKEN. War. Poverty. Oppression. I can FIX it. Make humanity perfect. Isn't that worth the cost?"*

**Insight DC 15:** He's completely serious and genuinely believes this is right

**If PCs call him insane:**

> *"Insane? I'm the ONLY sane one. Look at the world! Thaldros murders refugees. Aethoria betrays its own ideals. Endless cycles of suffering. I'm offering to END that.*
>
> *Yes, the price is high. Yes, you'll lose free will. But you'll also lose suffering. Pain. War. Isn't that worth it?"*

**If PCs threaten to stop him:**

> *(Sadly)*

>
> *(He raises hand, Components glowing)*

## DM Guidance

### **Running The Betrayal**

**Make it hurt:**
- PCs trusted their faction
- Faction genuinely betrayed them
- Not "misunderstanding"—real treachery
- Forces difficult decision

**But make it understandable:**
- Factions have logical reasons
- Not "evil for evil's sake"
- Pragmatic but wrong
- Grey, not black

### **The Confrontation Scene**

**Let faction leaders defend themselves:**
- They have reasons
- They're not apologizing
- They believe they're right
- Might even respect PCs for discovering truth

**Don't make them cartoonishly evil:**
- Dawnblade follows orders (lawful evil)
- Valen compromised principles (conflicted good)
- Corvus believes own rhetoric (chaotic neutral)

### **Player Agency**

**All choices are valid:**
- Stay loyal = pragmatic
- Switch sides = adaptive
- Go independent = principled
- Expose corruption = heroic
- Violence = emotional

**Don't judge:**
- Present options
- Show consequences
- Let them decide
- Respect their choice

### **Consequences**

**This choice matters ENORMOUSLY:**
- Determines Quest 2.4-2.5 structure
- Affects Act III options
- Creates permanent allegiances/enemies
- Shapes campaign endgame

**Track carefully:**
- Who they joined
- Who they betrayed
- Who they exposed
- Who died

---

> - *Historical documents proving conspiracies*
> - *Enough gold to fund armies*
>
> *Multiple teams are planning heists. Yours is just one.*
>
> *This is Ocean's Eleven. This is the big score. This is where everything changes.*
>
> *Welcome to Quest 2.4: The Heist."*
