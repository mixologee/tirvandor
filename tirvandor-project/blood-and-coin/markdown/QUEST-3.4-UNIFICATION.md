## Quest Setup

**Ten days after Quest 3.3**

**Read Aloud:**

> *You stand at the docks. Frozen north before you. Ship prepared. Supplies loaded. Both kingdoms contributed everything: Maps (unreliable), supplies (essential), soldiers (volunteers—most won't return).*
>
> *Dawnblade and Valen see you off:*
>
> *Dawnblade: "Eight days left before he returns. Find the phylactery. Destroy it. Or we face him again. Forever."*
>
> *Valen: "You've done the impossible before. Do it one more time. Come back heroes. Or don't come back at all."*
>
> *(The ship launches. You're bound for the Frozen Kingdom. Legend. Nightmare. Tomb.)*

---

## The Voyage North

**Five days by ship through frozen seas:**

### **Day 1-2: Normal Sailing**

Uneventful. Crew nervous. Temperature dropping.

---

### **Day 3: The Ice Field**

**Read Aloud:**

> *Ice. Everywhere. Sea frozen solid. Ship can't advance. Navigator: "We're 200 miles from the Frozen Kingdom. Rest of journey on foot.*
>
> *You see it on horizon: Ancient city. Black stone. Towers of ice. Dead. Waiting.*

**PCs must abandon ship. March across frozen wasteland.**

---

### **DAY 4-5: The MARCH**

**Survival challenges:**

**Challenge 1: Blizzard**
- Survival DC 16 or take 2d6 cold damage per hour
- Constitution DC 15 or gain exhaustion
- Risk of getting lost (no visibility)

**Challenge 2: Frozen Undead**
- Encounter with **4 Wights** and **8 Zombies**
- Frozen in ice, thaw when PCs approach
- Cold-enhanced (resistance to fire)

**Challenge 3: The Phantom Legion**
- Ghostly army from ancient battle
- **6 Wraiths** (CR 5 each)
- Don't attack unless provoked
- Can be negotiated with (they hate Dread King too)

---

## The Frozen Kingdom

**Arrival at dead city:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *The Frozen Kingdom. 400 years abandoned. Black stone towers coated in ice. Streets empty. No movement. No sound. Just wind and cold.*
>
> *This was once capital of prosperous realm. 50,000 citizens. Now: Nothing. Just frozen monuments to dead ambition.*
>
> *The phylactery is here. Somewhere. But where?*

---

### **Investigation Phase**

**PCs must locate phylactery:**

**Option 1: Search Systematically**
- Investigation DC 18 (takes 2 days)
- Each day: 1d4 undead encounters
- Success: Find phylactery location

**Option 2: Use Magic**
- *Locate object* (doesn't work—phylactery warded)
- *Legend lore* (reveals clue in riddle form)
- *Divination* (gods give cryptic answer)

**Option 3: Question the Dead**
- *Speak with dead* on ancient corpses
- They remember (barely)
- "Crown... worn even in death... the throne room... always on throne..."

**The Clue:**

Phylactery is in the Dread King's original crown. He wears it always. Even when he "dies," crown remains. It's the phylactery itself.

**Revelation:** They've been fighting him wrong. Crown must be destroyed while he's dead (before he reforms).

---

## The Throne Room

**Center of dead city. Massive palace:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *The palace. Frozen. Grand hall leading to throne room. Ice sculptures of courtiers line the walls—these were real people once. Flash-frozen during the transformation.*
>
> *You reach throne room. Empty throne. Stone. Cold. And on it: A crown. Bone and black metal. Pulsing with necrotic energy.*
>
> *The phylactery. Unguarded. Just sitting there. As if daring you.*

---

### **The TRAP**

**It's too easy. It's a trap:**

**If PCs approach crown:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *As you reach for the crown, the air FREEZES. The throne room doors slam shut. Ice spreads across floor. And from the crown itself: A voice.*
>
> *"Did you truly think I'd leave it unguarded?"*
>
> *(The Dread King materializes. Early. He reformed FASTER this time.)*
>
> *"You've improved. So have I. Let's try this again."*

---

## Final Boss: The Dread King (Empowered)

**He's learned from first defeat. Now CR 19.**

**Changes from first fight:**
- Anticipated your tactics
- Pre-cast buffs (*globe of invulnerability*, *stoneskin*)
- Summoned guardians before you arrived
- Using environment (ice, cold)
- Fighting smarter, not harder

**Empowered Dread King (CR 19)**

**Same stats as before, but:**

**New Abilities:**

**Learned Tactics:** Advantage on saves against effects he's experienced before (your tactics from Quest 3.3).

**Frozen Domain:** Throne room is difficult terrain (ice). Each round, all creatures make DC 17 Con save or take 3d6 cold damage.

**Phylactery Link:** While within 60 ft. of crown, regenerates 20 HP per turn.

**Guardian Summons (1/Day):** Summons 4 **Ice Golems** (CR 10 each) from frozen courtiers.

---

### **The Real Challenge**

**This fight is two-fold:**

1. **Kill the Dread King** (again)
2. **Destroy the phylactery/crown** (before he regenerates)

**Problem:** Crown is AC 20, 100 HP, resistance to all damage except radiant and force. While Dread King alive, he defends it. If he dies, you have ~3 rounds before he reforms.

---

### **Battle Strategy**

**PCs must:**

**Phase 1: Defeat Dread King**
- Same as before but harder
- He knows your tricks
- Uses terrain advantage
- Ice Golems tank

**Phase 2: Destroy Crown (3 rounds)**
- After Dread King "dies"
- Crown is now attackable
- But clock is ticking
- And Ice Golems still fight

**Phase 3: Escape**
- Palace collapsing (phylactery was keystone)
- Must flee (Athletics/Acrobatics checks)
- Or get buried in ice

---

### **Alternative ApproachES**

**Smart PCs might:**

**Option A: Split Party**
- Some fight Dread King
- Others focus-fire crown
- Risky but effective

**Option B: Distract and Destroy**
- One PC distracts Dread King (kiting)
- Others destroy crown immediately
- When crown breaks, he dies permanently
- Very risky for distractor

**Option C: Environmental Hazard**
- Collapse palace around him
- Bring down ceiling
- Crown gets buried but possibly destroyed
- Riskiest

---

## Crown Destruction Scene

**When crown finally breaks:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *The crown SHATTERS. Bone splinters. Black metal fragments.*
>
> *The Dread King SCREAMS. Ancient voice filled with rage, terror, and disbelief.*
>
> *"No. NO! I conquered DEATH! I cannot—"*
>
> *(He disintegrates. Dust. Gone. Forever.)*
>
> *The ice begins melting. The frozen courtiers crumble. The Frozen Kingdom... is finally dead. And free.*
>
> *Outside, across the realm: Every undead he ever created collapses. Thousands of corpses finally rest.*
>
> *It's over. Truly over.*

---

## The Return

**Five days later. Return to allied kingdoms:**

**Hero'S Welcome:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *You return to find both kingdoms in celebration. News arrived ahead (via sending spells): The Dread King is DEAD. Permanently. The threat is ended.*
>
> *Streets packed with Thaldros and Aethoria citizens—together. No longer enemies. Unified by shared victory.*
>
> *Dawnblade and Valen meet you with full military honors. Banners of both kingdoms side-by-side.*
>
> *"You've saved us three times now," Valen says. "Prevented the war. United us against the undead. And ended the greatest threat we've ever faced."*
>
> *Dawnblade nods. "Both kingdoms owe you everything. Name your reward. Anything."*
>
> *(They're serious. Anything.)*

---

## The Proposal

**PCs can now shape the future:**

### **Option 1: REQUEST GOLD**

**Simple:**
- 10,000gp (enormous wealth)
- Lands and titles
- Lifetime pensions
- Retire as legends

**Outcome:**
- Kingdoms remain separate but allied
- Peace holds (strong alliance)
- You're wealthy heroes
- Act III ends with stable peace

---

### **Option 2: Propose Full Unification**

**Bold:**

**Persuasion DC 18** to seriously consider:

**Argument:**
> "You've proven you can work together. The peace is strong. Why maintain the division? Unify. One nation. Stronger together."

**Dawnblade's Response:**
> "Merge Thaldros and Aethoria? Monarchy and democracy? How would that even work?"

**Valen's Response:**
> "Interesting. A federation? Constitutional monarchy? Some hybrid? It's... possible."

---

**If DC met, they consider it:**

**The Debate:**

**Three models proposed:**

**Model A: Constitutional Monarchy**
- King/Queen as figurehead
- Elected parliament with real power
- Combines tradition with democracy
- Persuasion DC 16 to get both to accept

**Model B: Federal Republic**
- Two states, one nation
- Thaldros keeps monarchy locally
- Aethoria keeps democracy locally
- Federal government above both
- Persuasion DC 17 (complex but fair)

**Model C: Complete Merger**
- Dissolve both governments
- Create entirely new system
- Emperor/Empress (elected? hereditary?)
- Persuasion DC 20 (radical change)

---

**If unification succeeds:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *Three months of negotiations. Compromises. Debates. Constitutional conventions. But finally:*
>
> *The Treaty of Unity. Thaldros and Aethoria become: The United Realm of Tirvandor.*
>
> *[Chosen system] established. Borders dissolved. One flag flies. One nation stands.*
>
> *Citizens celebrate. Merchants rejoice (unified markets). Generals approve (stronger military). Historians marvel.*
>
> *You've done it. Not just peace. Not just alliance. But true unification. Two ancient rivals become one.*
>
> *The world will never be the same.*

---

### **Option 3: REJECT BOTH**

**Humble:**
- "We want no reward. We did what was right."
- Reputation: +30 with everyone (legendary humility)
- Both kingdoms insist on giving SOMETHING
- Compromise: Statues erected, holidays named after you

---

### **Option 4: Make Specific Requests**

**PCs can request almost anything:**
- Pardon for past crimes
- Ressurect dead allies
- Hunt down specific enemies
- Change specific laws
- Free specific prisoners
- Literally almost anything reasonable

**Both kingdoms will grant it** (within reason).

---

## Rewards

**Based on choice:**

**If requested gold:** 10,000gp + lands + titles  
**If proposed unification:** 5,000gp + titles + LEGACY (changed history)  
**If rejected rewards:** 0gp + legendary reputation + moral satisfaction  

**Plus (all):**
- Dread King's artifacts (legendary items)
- Reputation: +30 with both kingdoms (or unified kingdom)
- Title: "Unifiers" or "Saviors" or "The Humble Heroes"
- Can retire or continue adventuring

---

## Level Up

---

## The Epilogue Preview

>
> *But you receive message. From both/all leaders. Urgent. One final matter requires your attention.*
