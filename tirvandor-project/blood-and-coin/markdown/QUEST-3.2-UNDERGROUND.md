>
> *Intel suggests 12-15 Unbound members. Mix of true believers and desperate recruits. Armed. Dangerous. Planning next attack.*
>
> *You can raid now. Or infiltrate first.*

---

### **Approach Options**

**Option A: FRONTAL RAID**

**Assault the safehouse directly:**

**Encounter:**

**12 Unbound Cultists** (Cultist stats, CR 1/8)

**Investigation DC 16:**
> *Next planned attack: Assassinate both Dawnblade AND Valen simultaneously at next diplomatic summit (3 days away). Two-pronged attack to decapitate moderate leadership.*

**Investigation DC 18:**
> *Financial records. Unbound cells being funded by... someone external. Wealthy patron. Identity unclear. Code name: "The Architect."*

---

### **The CHOICE**

**PCs learn of assassination plot:**

**Option 1: Warn Both Leaders**
- Prevent assassination
- Diplomatic summit canceled/secured
- Peace maintained
- BUT lose chance to capture assassins

**Option 2: Set Trap**

- Choose to save Dawnblade OR Valen
- Other leader dies
- Major political upheaval
- Shifts power balance

---

## Phase 2: Cell Beta (Border Guerrillas)

### **Thornwood Ruins**

**Read Aloud:**

> *You return to Thornwood Forest—where you hunted Red Wolf in Act I. The ruins of old fort still stand. But now: Unbound banners. Fortifications. Armed patrols.*
>
> *Cell Beta has transformed Red Wolf's base into guerrilla headquarters. Poetic. The freedom fighter's sanctuary now houses terrorists.*
>
> *Intel suggests 20-30 members. Mix of fighters and cultists. Led by someone called "The Reaper."*

> *(She gestures around)*
>
> *"But his work continues. I've gathered the faithful. Recovered Component fragments. And in two weeks: We'll complete what he started.*
>
> *"Operation Collapse. Simultaneous attacks worldwide. Not to kill—no. To create chaos. And in chaos, people BEG for order. They'll accept restructuring. They'll BEG for it.*

> *"My father tried to force salvation. I'll make them want it. Make them choose it.*
>
> *(She raises hand, Component glowing)*
>
> *"You can join us. Or die opposing us. Choose."*

---

### **The Final Choice**

**PCs can:**

**Option 1: FIGHT**

**Boss Fight:**

**The Prophet (Elara)** (CR 12)  
**6 Unbound High Priests** (Priest stats, CR 5)  
**20 Unbound Cultists** (CR 1/8, reinforcements)

**Phases:**
- Phase 1: Elara + 6 priests
- Phase 2 (at 75 HP): Cultists arrive, Elara uses Component Pulse
- Phase 3 (at 30 HP): Elara goes all-out, attempts plane shift to escape

**Tactics:**
- Priests buff Elara, debuff PCs
- Elara uses terrain control
- Focuses fire on one PC at a time
- If clearly losing, tries to escape

**If PCs win:**
- Cell Gamma destroyed
- Elara captured/killed
- Component fragment recovered
- Operation Collapse documents found

---

**Option 2: REDEEM**

**If PCs stopped Corvus but showed mercy before:**

**Persuasion DC 22** to reach Elara:

**Arguments:**
- "Your father was wrong, but he loved you"
- "This isn't salvation, it's tyranny"
- "Honor his memory by being better than him"
- "You can still choose differently"

**If successful (very hard):**
- Elara breaks down
- Admits she's scared, lost, angry
- Doesn't know if father was right
- Agrees to disband Unbound
- **Best ending**

**If failed:**
- "You don't understand. You never will. My father understood EVERYTHING."
- Combat initiated

---

**Option 3: JOIN HER**

**Accept Elara's offer:**

**This is evil.**

PCs become Unbound leadership. Help execute Operation Collapse. Enable tyranny. Bad ending.

**Don't offer this lightly.**

---

## Operation Collapse

**If Elara defeated/stopped:**

**Documents reveal full plan:**

**Investigation DC 14:**
> *10 coordinated attacks:*
> - *Thaldros Royal Palace*
> - *Aetheran Council Building*  
> - *5 major trade hubs*
> - *3 military installations*
>
> *Timed for same hour. Maximum chaos. Goal: Make people desperate for "strong leader" to restore order.*

**All attacks prevented** if Cell Gamma destroyed.

**If Cell Gamma escapes:** Attacks proceed (Quest 3.3 prevents them)

---

## Aftermath

**If all three cells destroyed:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *The Unbound are broken. Cells Alpha, Beta, and Gamma eliminated. Leadership killed or captured. Remaining members scatter, leaderless.*
>
> *Both kingdoms celebrate. Joint victory. Cooperation against shared enemy. The peace is stronger than ever—not perfect, but real.*
>
> *You did it. You saved the peace. Again.*
>
> *(But you're exhausted. How much longer can you keep this up?)*

---

## Rewards

**Based on cells destroyed:**

**All 3 cells:** 3,000gp + honors from both kingdoms

## Transition to QUEST 3.3

>
> *Then you're summoned to emergency session. Both Dawnblade and Valen present. Faces grim.*
>
> *"We have a problem. A threat bigger than Unbound. Something that could destroy both kingdoms.*
>
> *"Quest 3.3: The External Threat. It's not about us anymore. It's about survival."*
