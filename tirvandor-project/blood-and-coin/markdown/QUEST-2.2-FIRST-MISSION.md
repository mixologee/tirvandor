## Unbound Mission

**Level:** 7 | **Duration:** 2-3 sessions

### **[Beginning section from previous response through The Component discovery]**

---

### **The Moral Choice**

**PCs must decide:**

#### **Option 1: DELIVER TO CORVUS (Complete Mission)**

**Actions:**
- Take Component back to Corvus
- Help his apocalyptic plan progress
- Enable "reshaping" of reality

**Consequences:**
- Full payment: 1,000gp + 1 ancient artifact
- Reputation: +5 with Unbound
- Component now in Corvus's hands (2 of 5 collected)
- Apocalypse one step closer
- You've enabled potential mass death

**Corvus's reaction:**
> *"Perfect! This is brilliant work. Two Components secured. Three remain. Together, we'll save the world—whether it wants to be saved or not."*

---

#### **Option 2: DESTROY COMPONENT**

**Actions:**
- Attempt to destroy the artifact
- Use magic, smashing, etc.

**Reality:**
- Component is nearly indestructible
- Requires *disintegrate* spell or similar high-level magic
- DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana) to figure out how

**If destroyed:**
- No payment (mission failed)
- Reputation: -10 with Unbound (hunted)
- Component eliminated (apocalypse harder to achieve)
- World slightly safer
- Corvus becomes enemy

**Corvus's reaction:**
> *"You DESTROYED it? Centuries of research! The hope of humanity! You've doomed millions to continued suffering. I'll never forgive this."*

---

#### **Option 3: KEEP COMPONENT**

**Actions:**
- Take artifact for yourself
- Don't return to Corvus
- Power in your hands (corrupting?)

**Consequences:**
- No payment (stole from employer)
- Reputation: -10 with Unbound (hunted)
- Component's influence on you (corruption)
- Both kingdoms hunt you (want Component)
- Future plot: What do YOU do with it?

**Every long rest: Wisdom save DC 14 or Component influences your decisions**

---

#### **Option 4: GIVE TO OPPOSING FACTION**

**Actions:**
- Deliver Component to Thaldros or Aethoria
- Betray Corvus
- Let kingdom study/use it

**Consequences:**
- Payment: 3,000gp from kingdom (major prize)
- Reputation: -10 with Unbound (hunted)
- Reputation: +10 with kingdom
- Kingdom now has Component (also dangerous)
- They'll study it for military advantage
- Different apocalypse risk

**Kingdom reaction:**
> *"Extraordinary! Our scholars will study this. Its power could win the war. You've served [kingdom name] well. You're a hero."*

**Later (Quest 2.4): Learn kingdom is weaponizing it**

---

#### **Option 5: HIDE COMPONENT**

**Deception DC 17:**

**Plan:**
- Claim Component was destroyed in trap
- Hide it somewhere secret
- Keep its location known only to you

**If successful:**
- Half payment: 500gp (failed mission)
- Component hidden (future plot point)
- Neither Corvus nor kingdoms have it
- World safer for now
- You know where ultimate power is buried

---

### **Aftermath**

**If Component delivered:**

**Two Weeks Later:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *You hear rumors. The Unbound are becoming more active. More aggressive. Corvus is gathering followers—hundreds joining. He's promising salvation. A better world. An end to war.*
>
> *But there's something in his eyes now—a fervor that wasn't there before. Proximity to two Components is affecting him. He's more convinced than ever that his path is right.*
>
> *You helped him get closer to that goal. For better or worse.*

---

**If Component destroyed/stolen:**

**Two Weeks Later:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *The Unbound are furious. Corvus put a bounty on your heads—2,000 gold, dead or alive. You're hunted by cultists who believe you destroyed their salvation.*
>
> *But others—scholars, clergy, common folk—thank you quietly. "You may have saved us," one priest says. "Those Components are too dangerous for anyone."*
>
> *Whether you did right or wrong, you made a powerful enemy.*

---

## 📋 Multiple Factions Option

**If PCs are working for multiple factions simultaneously:**

### **The Juggling Act**

**They receive multiple missions:**

**Thaldros wants:** Convoy destroyed  
**Aethoria wants:** Thorne extracted  
**Unbound wants:** Component retrieved

**PCs must:**
1. Complete all three (nearly impossible timing)
2. Prioritize one, fail others
3. Try creative solutions

**Example Creative Solution:**
- Complete Unbound mission first (3 days)
- Then split party: half does convoy, half does extraction
- High risk, high reward

**Consequences:**
- If succeed all: Maximum gold (5,000gp+)
- If fail any: That faction becomes suspicious
- Eventually discovered (Quest 2.3)
- All factions turn on you when revealed

---

## DM Guidance

### **Running Parallel Missions**

**Each mission tests different moral boundaries:**

**Thaldros (Convoy):**
- Tests: Willingness to harm innocents
- Theme: Collateral damage
- Question: "How far for gold?"

**Aethoria (Defector):**
- Tests: Justice vs pragmatism
- Theme: Moral compromise
- Question: "Does the end justify the means?"

**Unbound (Component):**
- Tests: Power vs safety
- Theme: Playing with fire
- Question: "Should some knowledge be forbidden?"

### **No Right Answers**

**All three missions are morally grey:**
- Completing helps your faction but has moral cost
- Refusing weakens faction but preserves conscience
- Creative solutions are possible but risky

**Don't judge players:**
- Present situation fairly
- Show consequences
- Let them decide
- All choices are valid

### **Consequences Matter**

**These choices echo through Act II:**

**If killed refugees (Convoy):**
- Civilian NPCs distrust you
- Aethoria sees you as monsters
- Thaldros gives more "difficult" missions

**If protected war criminal (Defector):**
- Justice subverted
- Survivors remember
- But Aethoria wins intelligence advantage

**If delivered Component:**
- Apocalypse closer
- Corvus more powerful
- World more dangerous

**Track all consequences for later quests**

## Transition to QUEST 2.3

**Regardless of mission outcome:**

After 1-2 weeks, **Quest 2.3: The Double Cross** begins.

**Setup:**
- Your faction has been lying to you
- Evidence emerges of betrayal
- Must decide how to respond

**Preview:**

**Read Aloud (End Of Session):**

> *You completed your first major mission. Gold in hand. Reputation building. Everything seems fine.*
>
> *Then, late one night, you receive an anonymous letter. No signature. Just evidence—documents, testimonies, proof.*
>
> *Your faction has been lying to you. About everything.*

**[Quest 2.3 will reveal the Double Cross]**
