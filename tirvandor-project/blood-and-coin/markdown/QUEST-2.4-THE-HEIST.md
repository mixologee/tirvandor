## The Mission Briefing

**Your employer (varies) gives orders:**

### **If Working For Thaldros:**

**Commander Dawnblade (if still employed):**
> *"Aethoria intelligence suggests they're targeting the vault. We need you to get there first. Recover our military plans before they do. Also, there's a... component we need. Magical artifact. Retrieve it. Payment: 5,000 gold."*

### **If Working For Aethoria:**

**Envoy Valen (if still employed):**
> *"Thaldros keeps evidence of their crimes in the vault—including proof of manufactured atrocities. We need those documents to turn public opinion. Also, military intelligence. Payment: 3,000 gold plus whatever you find."*

### **If Working For Unbound:**

**Corvus Blackwood (if still employed):**
> *"Component #3 is in the royal vault. I NEED it. Get it for me. I don't care what else you take. Just bring me the Component. Payment: 2,000 gold plus ancient artifacts."*

### **IF INDEPENDENT:**

**Multiple buyers:**
- Thaldros: 5,000gp for Component + intelligence
- Aethoria: 3,000gp for documents + intelligence
- Unbound: 2,000gp for Component only
- Black Market: 10,000gp for everything (no questions)

**You can choose buyer AFTER the heist**

## Phase 1: Intelligence Gathering

**One week to prepare. PCs must gather intel:**

### **Research Checks**

**History DC 14 (Vault Background):**
> *Royal Vault built 300 years ago by dwarf architects. Five levels deep. Never successfully robbed. Three attempted heists—all thieves executed.*

**Investigation DC 16 (Security Systems):**
> *Five layers of security:*
> 1. *Outer perimeter (guards, patrols)*
> 2. *Magical wards (detect intruders)*
> 3. *Mechanical traps (lethal)*
> 4. *Puzzle locks (ancient dwarven)*
> 5. *Guardian (construct, never seen, only legends)*

**Persuasion DC 15 (Insider Information):**

**If PCs find former guard:**
> *"I worked vault security for five years. Shifts change at midnight. East entrance has blind spot. Wards can be temporarily dispelled if you have the right magic. But the Guardian... that's your real problem. No one knows what it is. Some say dragon. Some say demon. I say: don't find out."*

- 4 **Knights** at main entrance (CR 3 each)
- No obvious entrance to vault (underground)
- Magical shimmer around building (wards)

**Arcana DC 15:**
> *The wards are... impressive. Seventh-level magic. Detect intruders, prevent teleportation, sound alarm if bypassed incorrectly. But they pulse on a cycle—every 10 minutes, there's a 30-second window where they're weakest.*

**Disadvantages:** One mistake = alarm

---

**Approach 2: Social Engineering**

**Advantages:** Guards don't suspect  
**Disadvantages:** Requires multiple successful checks

---

**Approach 3: Distraction**

**Requirements:**
- Create major diversion elsewhere
- Fast entry while guards respond

**Plan:**
- Set fire/explosion in noble district

**Disadvantages:** High noise, attracts attention, rival teams might use same window

---

**Approach 4: Magical**

**Requirements:**

- Teleportation or dimension door
- Dispel magic at 7th+ level

**Plan:**

>
> *It's beautiful. Overwhelming. This is the kingdom's heart. 500 years of accumulated wealth and power.*
>
> *And you're not alone.*

---

## The Three-Way Encounter

**All three rival teams arrive simultaneously:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *From the east entrance: The Shadows emerge from invisibility. Four professional thieves, eyes on the gold.*
>
> *From the west stairs: The Fanatics storm in. Six Unbound cultists, chanting Corvus's name, eyes on the Component.*
>
> *From the south passage: [Team 3, your former faction's revenge squad], weapons drawn, eyes on YOU.*
>
