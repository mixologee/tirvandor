## 11. Crime Family Letter - Intercepted

```
[Written in crude handwriting on cheap paper]

Boss,

The shipment arrived. Three crates of "wine"
from across the sea. You know what I mean.

Problem: Guards asking questions. Someone
tipped them. I think it's the new guy, the
one with the scar. Don't trust him.

Payment: 500 crowns, as agreed. Meeting at
the usual place. Midnight. Three knocks.

Watch for the City Watch. They've been
sniffing around the warehouse district.

If this goes bad, I don't know you.

- K

[Stamp: A coin with a crown]

**DM Note:** Give this to players if they intercept/steal/find it. Can lead to ambush opportunity or tracking the crime ring.
