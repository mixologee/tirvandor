## CAMPAIGN THEMES

**Core Theme:** Moral ambiguity in conflict
- No faction is purely good or evil
- Player choices have lasting consequences
- War affects everyone differently
- Power corrupts, even good intentions

**Secondary Themes:**
- Loyalty vs. personal ethics
- Cost of peace vs. cost of war
- Individual agency in grand conflicts
- Redemption and betrayal

---

## IMPROVISATION TIPS

### When Players Go Off-Script
1. Have 2-3 random NPCs ready (names, personalities)
2. Keep generic combat encounters prepared (bandits, guards, monsters)
3. Use faction reactions to guide consequences
4. Remember: player choices should matter, but campaign can adapt

### Adjusting Difficulty
- **Too Easy:** Add reinforcements, environmental hazards, time pressure
- **Too Hard:** Give tactical advantage, allow clever solutions, add NPC aid
- **Just Right:** Players win but use resources, feel accomplished

### Pacing
- **Session feels slow:** Skip to action, introduce complication
- **Session feels rushed:** Add roleplay moment, let players breathe
- **Players stuck:** Give subtle hint through NPC or environmental clue

---

*Remember: This is YOUR campaign. Adapt freely, reward creativity, and most importantly—have fun!*
