**All three factions contact PCs simultaneously:**

### **Message From Thaldros**

**Commander Dawnblade (if still alive/employed):**

**Read Aloud:**

> *A royal courier arrives with sealed letter:*
>
> *"Final battle tomorrow. Victory is certain, but costly. We need you. Join Thaldros forces. Lead vanguard. Break Aethoria line. Payment: 5,000 gold plus lands and titles. This is your chance to be on the winning side. Refuse, and you're enemies of the crown. —Commander Dawnblade"*

---

### **Message From Aethoria**

---

## The Choice Point

**PCs must decide (can take 1-2 sessions to deliberate):**

---

# 🏰 Path 1: Thaldros Victory

**If PCs choose to fight for Thaldros:**

## The Battle

### **Deployment**

**Read Aloud:**

> *Dawn breaks. You stand with Thaldros vanguard—500 elite soldiers. Commander Dawnblade briefs you:*
>
> *"Aethoria's left flank is weak. Volunteers, poor training. Break through there. Collapse their line. Victory is ours. You lead the charge. For the kingdom!"*
>
> *Behind you: 10,000 Thaldros soldiers.*  
> *Across the field: 8,000 Republican defenders.*  
> *Above: Carrion birds, waiting.*

---

### **Phase 1: The CHARGE**

**PCs lead 500 soldiers against Aethoria left flank:**

**Encounter:**
- 300 **Aethoria Militia** (Commoner stats, CR 0, poorly trained)
- 50 **Republican Veterans** (Guard stats, CR 1/8)
- 1 **Republican Commander** (Knight stats, CR 3)

**This is a massacre.**

**PCs can:**
- **Fight honorably:** Kill only soldiers, spare surrendering
- **Fight ruthlessly:** Kill everyone, break morale faster
- **Show mercy:** Try to minimize casualties (harder)

**Combat Summary (not every soldier):**
- Militia breaks after 50% casualties
- Veterans fight to last man
- Commander demands single combat (PC can accept)

**If PCs win:**
- Left flank collapses
- Thaldros floods through breach
- Aethoria line crumbles

---

### **Phase 2: The PURSUIT**

**Aethoria forces retreat:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *They're running. Aethoria soldiers fleeing in disarray. Dawnblade orders: "Pursue! No quarter! End this!"*
>
> *You see them: terrified young soldiers, farmers with spears, people who believed in democracy. Running for their lives.*
>
> *Orders are orders. But...*

**The Choice:**

**Option A: Follow Orders**
- Pursue and kill retreating soldiers
- War crime but effective
- Aethoria routed completely
- Thaldros victory assured

**Option B: Show Mercy**
- Let them retreat
- Disobey orders
- Dawnblade furious but battle won anyway

---

### **Phase 3: The Final Stand**

**Aethoria makes last stand at command tent:**

**Boss Fight:**

**Envoy Valen (if alive) + Republican Champions:**

**Envoy Valen** (CR 6, as previous stats)  
**4 Republican Champions** (Veteran stats, CR 3 each)

**Read Aloud:**

> *Valen stands defiant, bloody, defeated but not broken:*
>
> *"So. You chose tyranny. I hope it's everything you dreamed. When the king turns on you—and he will—remember this moment. Remember you had a choice."*

**PCs can:**
- **Kill them:** Complete victory, no mercy
- **Capture them:** Take prisoners, war trials later
- **Let them flee:** Final mercy (Dawnblade will be angry)

---

### **Outcome: Thaldros Victory**

**If Thaldros wins:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *Aethoria falls. Republic collapses. Democracy dies on this field.*
>
> *Thaldros banners fly over captured territory. Valen executed (if captured). Survivors flee to distant lands.*
>
> *You're heroes of the kingdom. Commander Dawnblade promotes you. King grants titles, lands, gold.*
>
> *But walking through the battlefield afterward, you see: 3,000 dead. Mostly Aethoria militia—farmers, shopkeepers, people who believed freedom was worth fighting for.*
>
> *You helped create this. You helped tyranny win.*
>
> *Was it worth it?*

**Rewards:**
- 5,000gp
- Lands and titles (become landed nobility)
- Reputation: +20 with Thaldros
- Reputation: -30 with Aethoria survivors
- **ACT III Path A: THALDROS VICTORY**

# 🗽 Path 2: Aethoria Victory

**If PCs choose to fight for Aethoria:**

## The Defense

### **Deployment**

**Read Aloud:**

> *You stand with Aethoria defenders—outnumbered, outmatched, but not outspirited. Envoy Valen addresses troops:*
>
> *"They have more soldiers. Better armor. Royal gold. We have something they don't: we're fighting for our freedom. Today, we prove democracy is worth dying for. For the Republic!"*
>
> *Behind you: 8,000 Republicans.*  
> *Across the field: 10,000 Thaldros soldiers.*  
> *You're outnumbered. But not outmaneuvered.*

---

### **Phase 1: The DEFENSE**

**Thaldros charges:**

**Encounter:**
- 200 **Thaldros Heavy Infantry** (Guard stats, CR 1/8)
- 20 **Thaldros Knights** (Knight stats, CR 3)
- 1 **Commander** (Veteran, CR 5)

**PCs lead defensive position:**

**Tactics:**
- Use terrain (trenches, barriers)
- Focus fire on knights
- Hold the line

**This is desperate defense.**

**If PCs hold 5 rounds:**
- Thaldros assault breaks
- First wave repelled
- Morale boost for Aethoria

---

### **Phase 2: The COUNTER-ATTACK**

**Valen orders guerrilla strike:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *"While they regroup, we strike their supply lines. Their siege weapons. Their command tent. Guerrilla warfare. This is how we win—not by matching their strength, but by attacking their weaknesses."*

**PCs lead strike team:**

**Mission Options (choose 2 of 3):**

1. **Destroy Siege Weapons**
   - Stealth mission to Thaldros rear
   - Sabotage 6 trebuchets
   - Prevents bombardment

2. **Assassinate Commander**
   - Infiltrate command tent
   - Kill/capture Dawnblade
   - Decapitate leadership

3. **Free Prisoners**
   - Liberate captured Republicans
   - Boost morale
   - Gain reinforcements

**Each mission: 2-3 skill challenges + 1 combat encounter**

**If succeed both:**
- Thaldros momentum broken
- Aethoria gains initiative

---

### **Phase 3: The ROUT**

**Thaldros morale collapses:**

**Boss Fight:**

**Commander Dawnblade (if alive) + Honor Guard:**

**Commander Helena Dawnblade** (CR 10, as previous stats)  
**6 Royal Knights** (Knight stats, CR 3 each)

**Read Aloud:**

> *Dawnblade makes final stand, surrounded but unbroken:*
>
> *"So. You chose chaos over order. When democracy fails—and it will—remember I offered you stability. You chose mob rule."*
>
> *(She raises her sword)*
>
> *"But I'm still a soldier. I'll die like one."*

**PCs can:**
- **Kill her:** Symbolic victory, no mercy
- **Force surrender:** Take prisoner, use as leverage
- **Let her retreat:** Honorable combat

---

### **Outcome: Aethoria Victory**

**If Aethoria wins:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *Thaldros breaks. Royal army retreats. Kingdom loses the war.*
>
> *Republican flags fly. Democracy survives. Freedom preserved.*
>
> *You're heroes of the revolution. Valen promotes you to generals. Senate grants citizenship, honors, gold.*
>
> *But walking through the battlefield afterward, you see: 2,500 dead. Mostly young Republicans—believers, idealists, people who died for a cause.*
>
> *And the kingdom? Fragmenting. Warlords claiming territory. Chaos spreading.*
>
> *You helped create this. You helped chaos win.*
>
> *Was it worth it?*

**Rewards:**
- 3,000gp
- Military ranks (Republican Generals)
- Citizenship and honors
- Reputation: +20 with Aethoria
- Reputation: -30 with Thaldros survivors
- **ACT III Path B: AETHORIA VICTORY**

# 🔥 Path 3: Unbound Apocalypse

**If PCs choose to help Corvus:**

## The Heist During Battle

### **The Plan**

**Corvus explains:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *"While they slaughter each other, we steal what matters. King Aldric IV carries Component #4 as protective talisman. General Marcus Vale (Aethoria) has Component #5. They don't know what they carry.*
>
> *You infiltrate both sides during battle chaos. Steal both Components. Bring them to me. I'll perform the ritual.*
>
> *Tomorrow, we remake the world. No more war. No more suffering. Perfection.*
>
> *(His eyes are wild, intense)*
>
> *This is what we've worked for. This is salvation."*

---

### **Phase 1: STEAL COMPONENT #4 (Thaldros King)**

**Infiltrate Thaldros royal command:**

**Challenges:**
- Disguise as Thaldros soldiers (Deception DC 16)
- Reach royal pavilion during battle (Stealth DC 17)
- Bypass King's Honor Guard (6 Knights, CR 3)
- Steal Component from King's person (Sleight of Hand DC 20 or combat)

**Encounter:**

**King Aldric IV** (CR 9, uses Archmage stats with protection spells)

**PCs can:**
- **Stealth steal:** Pickpocket during battle chaos
- **Combat:** Fight King and guards
- **Deception:** Trick him into giving it up

---

### **Phase 2: STEAL COMPONENT #5 (Aethoria General)**

**Infiltrate Aethoria command:**

**Challenges:**
- Navigate battle (Survival DC 15)
- Reach Aethoria command tent (Stealth DC 16)
- Bypass Republican Guards (8 Veterans, CR 3)
- Steal Component from General (Sleight of Hand DC 19 or combat)

**Encounter:**

**General Marcus Vale** (CR 7, uses Champion stats)

**PCs can:**
- **Stealth steal:** While General commands troops
- **Combat:** Assassinate General, take Component
- **Persuasion:** Convince him to give it up (nearly impossible)

---

### **Phase 3: The RITUAL**

**Deliver Components to Corvus:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *You return to Corvus with both Components. He now has all five. His hands shake with anticipation.*
>
> *"Perfect. PERFECT! Now, the ritual. Reality will bend. The world will change. Humanity will be saved."*
>
> *(He begins arranging Components in circle—intricate pattern, glowing with power)*
>
> *"When I activate this, 30-40% of population will die. Necessary sacrifice. The rest will enter new world order. No free will, but no suffering. Perfect peace. Perfect control."*
>
> *(He looks at you)*
>
> *"Are you with me? Or do you lack the courage to save humanity?"*

---

### **The Final Choice**

**PCs must decide:**

**Option A: LET RITUAL COMPLETE**

**Corvus succeeds:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *Corvus chants. Components pulse with power. Reality TEARS.*
>
> *Across the battlefield, soldiers stop fighting. They CHANGE. Eyes glaze. Expressions flatten. Free will... gone.*
>
> *Cities across the world: Same effect. Millions simply... stop. Then fall. Dead. Necessary casualties.*
>
> *You feel it—pull on your mind. But Components protect you. You're exempt. Wardens of New Order.*
>
> *The old world dies. The new world is born.*

**Outcome: UNBOUND APOCALYPSE**

**Consequences:**
- 35% of world population dies (instant)
- Remaining 65% lose free will
- Corvus rules as Archon
- You're Wardens (governors of regions)
- Perfect order, zero freedom
- **ACT III Path C: UNBOUND APOCALYPSE**

**Rewards:**
- 2,000gp (symbolic, money is meaningless now)

---

**Stopping war requires:**

1. Expose war conspiracy (from Quest 2.4 documents)
2. Convince both sides to stand down
3. Broker peace treaty
4. Survive assassination attempts from warmongers

**This is the HARDEST path.**

---

**Attendees:**
- Commander Dawnblade (Thaldros)
- Envoy Valen (Aethoria)
- PCs (mediators)
- Witnesses

**Read Aloud:**

> *Neutral tent. Two enemies sit across from each other. Documents between them—proof of conspiracy.*
>
> *Dawnblade: "This... this is real? High command manufactured this war?"*
>
> *Valen: "Our senate too. We've been played. Both of us."*
>
> *(They look at each other—first time seeing shared victimhood)*
>
> *Dawnblade: "So what now? Do we fight knowing it's a lie?"*
>
> *You have a chance. Broker peace.*

---

### **Negotiation Rounds**

**Four rounds of Persuasion checks:**

**Round 1: Ceasefire**
- DC 16: Convince both to stop fighting TODAY
- Success: Temporary ceasefire
- Failure: Negotiations collapse, return to war

**Round 2: Terms**
- DC 17: Define peace treaty terms
- Success: Border status quo, trade agreement
- Failure: Can't agree on territory

**Round 3: Justice**
- DC 18: What happens to conspirators?
- Success: Joint tribunal, public trials
- Failure: Each side protects own criminals

**Round 4: Future**
- DC 19: Long-term coexistence plan
- Success: Permanent peace treaty, alliance
- Failure: Temporary truce only

**Required: All 4 rounds successful for lasting peace**

**3 or fewer: Temporary truce (eventually fails)**

**Must survive all three to complete peace**

---

### **Outcome: Peace Achieved**

**If all negotiations successful AND survived assassinations:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *Two months later. Treaty of Judgment Border signed. War ends. Ceasefire holds.*
>
> *It's fragile. Hardliners on both sides grumble. Tensions remain. But no one's dying today.*
>
> *You brokered peace. Ended a war. Saved thousands of lives.*
>
> *Statues erected in your honor. Songs sung. "The Peacemakers," they call you.*
>
> *But you know the truth: Peace requires constant maintenance. One wrong move and it shatters. You'll spend Act III defending what you built.*
>
> *Was it worth it? Ask the people who didn't die.*

**Outcome: PEACE ACHIEVED**

**Rewards:**
- 3,000gp (from grateful citizens' fund)
- Reputation: +30 with common folk
- Reputation: +10 with moderate leaders

---

# ⚔️ Path 5: Total War

**If PCs do nothing or fail to tip balance:**

## The Stalemate

**War begins. PCs stay neutral or choose no side:**

**Read Aloud:**

>
> *This repeats. Day after day. Week after week. Month after month.*
>
> *You're mercenaries. You survive. But the war? It never ends.*

---

### **Phase 1-3: Endless Battle**

**PCs can fight for either side as freelancers:**

**Per battle engagement:**
- 1-2 combat encounters
- 500-1,000gp payment
- XP and exhaustion

**But no resolution. No victory. Just grinding attrition.**

---

### **Outcome: Total War**

**If neither side wins:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *Six months later. War continues. Casualty count: 15,000+ dead. No end in sight.*
>
> *Both kingdoms bleeding resources. Neither willing to surrender. Pride and sunk costs keep it going.*
>
> *Mercenary work is plentiful. Tragic but profitable. You're wealthy but exhausted. And the war? It'll outlive you.*
>
> *This is the worst timeline. No winner. Only losers. And you didn't stop it.*

**Outcome: TOTAL WAR**

**Rewards:**
- 2,000gp (mercenary payments)
- Reputation: Neutral with both (neither trusts you)
- Title: "The Survivor"

---

## Act II Ending

**Regardless of outcome:**

---

## DM Guidance

### **Running the Finale**

**Make it EPIC:**
- This is Act II climax
- Armies, magic, politics
- Everything players did matters
- High stakes, high drama

**But keep it personal:**
- Focus on PCs' actions
- Don't get lost in armies (abstract large battles)
- Individual choices matter
- Their story, not generals' story

### **The Five Outcomes**

**Present all as equally valid:**
- No "correct" ending
- Each has costs and benefits
- PCs choose based on values
- All paths lead to Act III

**Track everything:**
- Which outcome occurred
- Who lived/died
- What was revealed
- What remains hidden
- This determines all of Act III

### **Player Agency**

**Ultimate test:**
- Can PCs broker peace? (Path 4)
- Or do they choose a side? (Paths 1-2)
- Or enable apocalypse? (Path 3)
- Or do nothing? (Path 5)

**All are valid choices.**

**Respect their decision and show consequences honestly.**
