## Quest Setup

**One year after Quest 3.4**

**Read Aloud:**

> *One year since you destroyed the Dread King. One year since the unification (or strong alliance). One year of peace. True peace.*
>
> *You're legends now. Songs sung about you. Statues in every city. Children play "Peacekeepers vs. Dreadhost." You're immortalized.*
>
> *But legends can't rest. Not yet. One final summons arrives: "Emergency council. Your presence required. Immediately."*
>
> *You arrive at the grand hall (Thaldros palace or new unified parliament, depending on Quest 3.4 outcome) to find: Every major NPC from the entire campaign. Everyone who survived. All gathered.*
>
> *Something big is happening.*

---

**Everyone you've touched across 15 levels and 15 quests.**

---

## The Revelation

**Dawnblade speaks:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *"We've gathered everyone because we must decide: What happens to the Peacekeepers?*
>
> *"You've served beyond any reasonable expectation. Three years. Fifteen impossible tasks. You've earned rest. Retirement. Whatever you want.*
>
> *"But the peace you built still needs maintenance. Disputes arise. Tensions flare. Having neutral arbiters—trusted by all—is vital.*
>
> *"The question: Do the Peacekeepers continue? And if so... is it still you?"*

---

**Valen continues:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *"We propose three options:*
>
> *"ONE: You continue as Peacekeepers. Forever (or until you die). The peace rests on your shoulders. Eternal duty.*
>
> *"TWO: You train successors. Pass the mantle. Build an institution. Peacekeepers continue, but not necessarily YOU.*
>
> *"THREE: You retire. The role of Peacekeeper ends with you. We'll figure something else out.*
>
> *"But the choice is yours. You earned it. You decide how your story ends."*

---

## The Final Choice

**This is it. The campaign-defining decision:**

---

### **Ending 1: Eternal Vigil**

**PCs choose to continue as Peacekeepers:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *You accept. The peace needs guardians. You'll be those guardians. For as long as you live.*
>
> *Years pass. Decades. You mediate disputes. Prevent wars. Train new generations. You become myths. Living legends who never stop.*
>
> *Some of you marry. Have families. Grow old. But the duty never ends. Every generation has new conflicts. New threats. And you're there. Always.*
>
> *Eventually, one by one, you fall. Age. Battle. Sacrifice. But each time, the survivors carry on. Until the last Peacekeeper dies, ancient and tired, having served for 50+ years.*
>
> *Your legacy: You gave everything. Every year. Every day. The peace held because YOU held it.*
>
> *Is that enough?*

**Epilogue:**

**Each PC gets personal ending:**
- Marriages, families, achievements
- How they died (heroically or peacefully)
- What they're remembered for
- Statues, holidays, legends

**World State:**
- Peace holds for 50+ years
- Minor conflicts but never war
- Prosperity, growth, progress
- Your sacrifice made it possible

**DM narrates individual player epilogues based on their choices throughout campaign.**

---

### **Ending 2: The Institution**

**PCs choose to train successors:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *You accept the compromise. You'll create the Peacekeeper Academy. Train the next generation. Build an institution that outlives you.*
>
> *Five years of work. You recruit, train, test hundreds of candidates. You select the best: Young, idealistic, skilled. You teach them everything you know.*
>
> *Diplomacy. Combat. Investigation. Ethics. When to fight. When to talk. When to compromise. The grey wisdom you learned across 15 quests.*
>
> *Eventually, the Academy is self-sustaining. 50 trained Peacekeepers. 200 in training. An institution. A legacy.*
>
> *You finally retire. Different paths:*

**Individual Retirements:**

**PCs can choose:**
- **Settle down:** Marry, family, peaceful life
- **Keep adventuring:** New quests, personal goals
- **Politics:** Join government, shape policy
- **Teaching:** Stay at Academy as instructors
- **Disappear:** Vanish into anonymity, mystery

**Epilogue:**

**Each PC gets personalized ending based on choice.**

**World State:**
- Peace holds (institutionally maintained)
- Peacekeeper Academy becomes legendary
- New generation takes over
- You watch from retirement, proud

---

### **Ending 3: Retirement**

**PCs choose to end the role entirely:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *You decline. "The peace should stand on its own. If it requires us forever, it's not real peace. It's dependency."*
>
> *(Shocked silence)*
>
> *Dawnblade: "But who will—"*
>
> *You: "You will. All of you. You've relied on us for three years. Time to grow up. Make it work yourselves."*
>
> *(It's harsh. But it's true.)*
>
> *You walk away. The role of Peacekeeper ends with you. The kingdoms must learn to maintain peace themselves.*

**What happens next?**

**Roll d20 for world outcome:**

**1-5: Peace Breaks**
- Without you, kingdoms revert to conflict
- War resumes within 5 years
- Your legacy: Temporary solution
- Tragic ending

**6-15: Peace Holds (Barely)**
- Rough transition
- Several close calls
- But kingdoms mature
- Learn to maintain peace independently
- Your legacy: Taught them to fish

**16-20: Peace Strengthens**
- Without dependence on heroes, institutions improve
- Systems replace individuals
- Democracy works
- Permanent peace emerges
- Your legacy: You made yourselves unnecessary (highest achievement)

**DM chooses or rolls based on how well PCs prepared the kingdoms throughout campaign.**

**Individual Retirements:**

Same options as Ending 2 - each PC retires how they wish.

---

## Personal Epilogues

**Regardless of ending chosen, each PC gets personalized conclusion:**

### **Epilogue Scene For Each Pc**

**DM asks each player:**

1. "How does [PC name] spend their final years?"
2. "What's their greatest personal achievement post-campaign?"
3. "How are they remembered?"
4. "When/how do they die?" (if desired)

**Narrate based on their choices throughout campaign:**

**Example 1: Warrior PC who showed mercy**
> *You settle in a small village. Open a training hall. Teach young people combat—but more importantly, when NOT to fight. You become legendary not for battles won, but for battles prevented. You die at 80, surrounded by grateful students, having never killed another person after the campaign ended.*

**Example 2: Rogue PC who stayed pragmatic**
> *You use your vast wealth to build trade empire. Smuggling networks become legitimate businesses. You create thousands of jobs. Die rich, respected, and slightly bored. Your fortune funds scholarships for thieves who want to go straight.*

**Example 3: Cleric PC who struggled with faith**
> *You write theological treatise: "The Gods in Grey." Becomes foundational text for new religious philosophy embracing moral complexity. Start new religious order. Die peacefully, faith intact, having reconciled belief with reality.*

**Customize for each PC based on their journey.**

---

## The Reunion (20 Years Later)

**Optional final scene:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *Twenty years later. You gather at memorial site (statue of yourselves, or Academy, or battleground). Most of you are alive. Some aren't. Some came as ghosts to see friends one more time.*
>
> *(PCs who died can appear as spirits for this scene)*
>
> *You look at each other. Older. Grey. Scarred. But alive. You survived.*
>
> *Someone raises toast: "To the Peacekeepers. To the impossible. To blood, coin, and everything between."*
>
> *You drink. You remember. You laugh about old fights. Cry about fallen friends. Wonder at what you built.*
>
> *Then you look out at the world you created: Peace. Prosperity. Children playing where battles were fought. Enemies' grandchildren marrying each other.*
>
> *Was it worth it? Every impossible choice. Every moral compromise. Every sleepless night.*
>
> *(You look at each other. And smile.)*
>
> *Yeah. It was worth it.*

## Thank You

**To the players who became Peacekeepers:**

You navigated impossible choices. You found paths through moral mazes. You proved that heroism exists even in grey worlds.

You weren't perfect heroes. You were REAL heroes. Flawed, struggling, compromising, but ultimately choosing right more often than wrong.

Thank you for playing Blood & Coin.

You guided players through 15 quests of moral complexity. You presented dilemmas without easy answers. You respected player agency. You maintained consistency across 50+ sessions.

That's masterful DMing.
