---

## Quest Setup

**Time:** Six months after Quest 1.5 (Act I finale)

**What's Changed:**
- Your reputation has spread across both kingdoms
- Regional tensions escalating toward war
- Naval skirmishes increasing
- Trade routes disrupted
- Everyone choosing sides

**Read Aloud:**

> *Six months have passed since [reference their Act I ending]. Life in Crossroads continued—contracts, gold, survival. But the world beyond hasn't been idle.*
>
> *Rumors of war spread like wildfire. The Crown and the frontier territories—in tension for decades—are now at each other's throats. Trade conflicts. Assassinations. Embargo threats. Everyone sees it coming.*
>
> *And everyone wants mercenaries.*
>
> *This morning, three separate messages arrived for you. Three different factions. Three offers. All arriving the same day.*
>
> *That can't be coincidence.*

---

## The Three Messages

**PCs receive three sealed letters:**

### **Message 1: Royal Seal**

*Ornate envelope, wax seal bearing crown of Thaldros*

> **"To the Mercenaries of [their group name/reputation]:**
>
> Your services are requested by Commander Helena Dawnblade of the Royal Army of Thaldros. A matter of national importance and significant compensation.
>
> Present yourselves at the Wayward Inn, private room, today at noon.
>
> Discretion is expected. Professionalism will be rewarded.
>
> **—Commander H. Dawnblade, Knight-Commander, Order of the Dawn"**

---

### **Message 2: Republican Paper**

*Simple paper, no seal, republican symbol stamped*

> **"Friends:**
>
> The Aetheran Council needs capable individuals who understand that freedom is worth fighting for. Envoy Marcus Valen wishes to discuss an opportunity that serves both your interests and the cause of their alliance.
>
> Wayward Inn, private room, today at 2pm.
>
> Come if you believe people deserve to choose their own destiny.
>
> **—Senator M. Valen, Aetheran Council, Committee on External Affairs"**

---

### **Message 3: Blank Envelope**

*No seal, no signature, just an address and time*

> **"The old world is dying. A new one will be born.**
>
> Those with vision are needed. Those with courage are welcome.
>
> Wayward Inn, private room, today at 4pm.
>
> Come if you're tired of choosing between tyrants and mobs.
>
> **—A Friend"**

---

## The Wayward Inn

### **Location**

A well-known neutral ground in Crossroads. No guild affiliations. No political loyalties. Perfect for clandestine meetings.

**Read Aloud:**

> *The Wayward Inn sits on the border between Iron Guild and Black Chains territory—neutral ground by necessity. It's where deals get made when both sides need to pretend they're not cooperating.*
>
> *The innkeeper, Old Marcus, is famous for two things: excellent whiskey and aggressive neutrality. He'll throw out anyone who starts trouble, regardless of guild, rank, or gold.*
>
> *Three private rooms have been reserved today. All paid in advance. All requesting the same mercenaries.*
>
> *Someone's been coordinating.*

---

## Meeting 1: Commander Helena Dawnblade (Noon)

### **The Setting**

**Read Aloud:**

> *The first private room is tastefully appointed. A fire crackles. Wine and cheese set out. Military precision in every detail.*
>
> *Commander Helena Dawnblade stands by the window, backlit by noon sun. She's imposing—six feet tall, silver armor polished to mirror sheen, holy symbol of Thaldros prominent on her chest. Late 40s, steel-grey hair in tight braid, face bearing scars from decades of service.*
>
> *She turns as you enter. Her eyes assess you with military efficiency.*
>
> *"Sit," she says. Not a request. "We have much to discuss and little time for pleasantries."*

---

### **Dawnblade'S Pitch**

**Read Aloud:**

> *She pours wine—expensive vintage—and slides a glass toward you.*
>
> *"I'll be direct. War is coming. Aethoria's 'democracy' threatens regional stability. Mob rule dressed as freedom. If they win, chaos spreads. Trade collapses. Bandits rule. Society crumbles.*
>
> *Thaldros is order. Civilization. Law. We've maintained peace for 500 years through strength and structure. We intend to continue.*
>
> *I'm assembling a team of... specialists. Professionals who understand that sometimes order requires difficult choices. Your reputation suggests you're such professionals.*
>
> *Work for the crown. Significant compensation. Legal protection. Political connections. And when we win—not if, WHEN—you'll be on the winning side."*

**She slides a contract across the table:**

**The Offer:**
- **Upfront Payment:** 2,500 gold pieces (deposited today)
- **Per Mission:** 1,000-2,000gp depending on difficulty
- **Authority:** Deputized as crown agents (can act with royal authority)

**The Expectations:**
- Intelligence gathering on Aethoria military
- Sabotage of enemy supply lines
- "Neutralization" of key targets (assassination)
- Publicly: "Defending the kingdom"
- Privately: "Whatever's necessary to win"

---

### **Questions & Answers**

**If PCs ask questions:**

**"Why us specifically?"**
> *"Your work speaks for itself. [Reference Act I achievements]. You're competent. More importantly, you understand grey areas. Perfect soldiers follow orders without question. Perfect mercenaries complete contracts despite complications. I need the latter."*

**"What if we refuse?"**
> *"Then you refuse. I'm not the Aethoria mob—I don't force allegiance. But this war will touch everyone. Neutrality becomes harder every day. Choose a side, or have one chosen for you."*

**"Is Thaldros really the 'good guys'?"**
> *(If PCs reference Quest 1.5 and Marcus Blackwood's trial)*
> *"Good? No. Better? Yes. Thaldros has problems—I won't deny it. Corruption exists. Justice isn't always just. But compare us to Aethoria's chaos. We're stable. Functional. That matters."*

**"What about civilian casualties?"**
> *"War has costs. I'll give you missions with... clear objectives. How you achieve them is your discretion. I need results, not reports on methods. Does that answer your question?"*

**Insight DC 15:**
- Dawnblade is sincere but knows she's hiring for morally grey work
- She's uncomfortable with some orders from above
- Respects PCs enough to be honest about what's expected
- Will follow orders even if they're war crimes

**Persuasion DC 18 (to get her to reveal doubts):**
> *(Privately, checking no one listening)*
> *"Off the record? I've served Thaldros 30 years. I've seen it do great things and terrible things. But I've also seen what happens when government collapses. Famine. Warlords. Suffering.*
>
> *Order is worth defending, even when order is imperfect. That's my oath. If you can't accept that, walk away now. No judgment."*

---

### **Dawnblade'S Secret Agenda**

**What she's NOT telling PCs:**

1. **Scapegoat Plan:** Crown intends to frame mercenaries for war crimes post-war
2. **Marcus Blackwood:** If PCs helped him (Quest 1.5), crown remembers—sees them as potential troublemakers
3. **Her Doubts:** She suspects some missions will be atrocities but will follow orders anyway
4. **The War:** High command knows war is partly manufactured for political reasons

**This information revealed later in Quest 2.3 (The Double Cross)**

---

## Meeting 2: Envoy Marcus Valen (2pm)

### **The Setting**

**Read Aloud:**

> *Same inn, different room. This one is simpler—wooden table, local wine, no extravagance. A statement.*
>
> *Envoy Marcus Valen stands as you enter. He's in his 50s, wearing republican robes (no finery), grey beard, warm eyes, genuine smile. He looks tired but hopeful.*
>
> *"Welcome, friends." His voice is warm, practiced. "Thank you for coming. Please, sit. I know Commander Dawnblade made her pitch this morning. Now hear ours."*

---

**Spells Known:**
- 1st level (4 slots): *charm person, disguise self, mage armor, sleep*
- 2nd level (3 slots): *detect thoughts, suggestion, zone of truth*
- 3rd level (3 slots): *counterspell, sending, tongues*
- 4th level (2 slots): *compulsion, greater invisibility*

#### Personality & Motivation

**Age:** 54  
**Appearance:** Republican robes (simple), grey beard, warm eyes, tired but determined, genuine smile

**Personality:**
- True believer in democracy
- Charismatic and inspiring
- Idealistic but not naive (knows corruption exists)
- Genuinely cares about common people

- "The ends justify the means" (sometimes)

- Lost family to Thaldros royal decree (land seizure)
- Believes democracy is humanity's future
- Understands Aethoria is flawed but fixable
- Willing to hire morally grey mercenaries

**Motivation:**
- Save democracy from monarchy
- Prove people can govern themselves
- Prevent Thaldros expansion
- Win war for republic's survival
- Knows Aethoria will make mistakes but believes in the system

---

### **Valen'S Pitch**

**Read Aloud:**

> *He doesn't pour wine. He opens a bottle of local beer—cheap, common, statement of solidarity.*
>
> *"Commander Dawnblade offered you gold and glory serving a king. I offer you a chance to serve something greater: freedom.*
>
> *Thaldros is a relic. Monarchy is a failed system where one family decides the fate of millions. The Aetheran Council is humanity's future—government by the people, for the people.*
>
> *Yes, we're messy. Democracy is loud, chaotic, inefficient. But it's OURS. We choose our leaders. We write our laws. We own our destiny.*
>
> *I won't lie—we're outmatched militarily. Thaldros has more soldiers, more gold, more resources. But we have something they don't: we're fighting for something we believe in.*
>
> *Help us. Not for gold—though we'll pay what we can. Not for power—though you'll be heroes of the revolution. Do it because tyranny must be opposed. Because people deserve to be free."*

**The contract he offers is handwritten, simple:**

**The Offer:**
- **Upfront Payment:** 1,500 gold pieces (less than Thaldros)
- **Per Mission:** 800-1,500gp depending on success
- **Authority:** Republican commission (less legal weight than crown)
- **Protection:** Popular support (common folk shelter you)
- **Post-War Rewards:** Citizenship, gratitude, historical recognition (not gold or lands)

**The Expectations:**
- Intelligence gathering on Thaldros nobility
- Smuggling weapons to resistance cells
- Protecting democratic leaders from assassination
- Publicly: "Fighting for freedom"
- Privately: "Winning at any cost"

---

### **Questions & Answers**

**If PCs ask questions:**

**"Why should we believe democracy works?"**
> *"Because it's already working. Look at Aethoria—we have problems, but we solve them through debate, not decree. When our leaders fail, we replace them. When Thaldros's king fails, people suffer for generations. Which system sounds better to you?"*

**"You're paying less than Thaldros."**
> *"We're a republic, not a monarchy. We don't have royal vaults. But what we offer is worth more than gold: you'll be on the right side of history. Your children will sing songs of how you fought tyranny. Can Dawnblade offer you that?"*

**"What if democracy fails?"**
> *"Then we'll have tried something noble and failed nobly. But I don't believe we'll fail. The people WANT freedom. They WANT choice. Thaldros rules through fear and tradition. We inspire through hope. Hope is stronger."*

**"Will you ask us to do terrible things?"**
> *(Pauses, uncomfortable)*
> *"War is terrible. Revolution is messy. Will I ask you to kill Thaldros soldiers? Yes. Sabotage supply lines? Yes. These are necessary evils to defeat a greater evil. I won't lie and say our hands stay clean. But we fight for a just cause. That matters."*

**Insight DC 14:**
- Valen is genuine but naive about some realities
- He believes in his cause deeply
- He knows Aethoria leadership has corruption too
- He's willing to compromise principles to win
- He sees PCs as tools for necessary evil

**Persuasion DC 16 (to get him to reveal doubts):**
> *"You want the truth? Aethoria isn't perfect. Some senators are corrupt. Some officials abuse power. Democracy doesn't eliminate human nature.*
>
> *But here's the difference: in Thaldros, when the king is corrupt, you're stuck with him for life. In Aethoria, we can vote him out. The system has safeguards. It's not perfect, but it's better. That's all I can promise—better, not perfect."*

---

### **Valen'S Secret Agenda**

**What he's NOT telling PCs:**

1. **Corruption:** Aethoria senate is more corrupt than he admits
2. **Post-War:** Some leaders plan to establish "temporary dictatorship" after victory
3. **Defector:** They're protecting a war criminal (General Thorne) for his intelligence
4. **The War:** Republic knows it's outmatched but hoping for guerrilla victory

**This information revealed later in Quest 2.3 (The Double Cross)**

---

## Meeting 3: Corvus Blackwood (4pm)

### **The Setting**

**Read Aloud:**

> *The third room is different. No fire. Candles instead. Bookshelves lining walls. Maps of ancient ruins scattered on table. Occult symbols—not evil, just... old.*
>
> *A man stands with his back to you, studying a map. He's in his 50s, wearing scholar's robes, grey hair tied back. When he turns, his eyes are intense—not mad, but focused with frightening clarity.*
>
> *"You came." His voice is measured, educated. "Good. That means you're thinking. Dawnblade offered order through oppression. Valen offered chaos through democracy. I offer a third option: burn it all down and build something better."*
>
> *He gestures to chairs.*
>
> *"My name is Corvus Blackwood. And I'm going to save the world."*

---

## Npc: Corvus Blackwood

*Medium humanoid (human), chaotic neutral*

**Armor Class:** 15 (18 with *mage armor*)  
**Hit Points:** 99 (18d8 + 18)  
**Speed:** 30 ft.

**Spell Mastery.** Can cast *detect magic* and *mage armor* at will without spell slots.

**Scholar of the Godsfall.** Expert on World-Splitter Components and ancient magic.

- 9th level (1 slot): *wish* (he plans to use this with Components)

#### Personality & Motivation

**Age:** 52  
**Appearance:** Scholar's robes, grey hair, intense eyes, surrounded by books and maps, focused, intelligent

**Personality:**
- Brilliant scholar and historian
- True believer in his cause
- Well-intentioned extremist
- Sees himself as humanity's savior
- Willing to sacrifice millions for "greater good"
- Not evil—just convinced he's right

**Background:**
- Studied Godsfall history for 30 years
- Discovered World-Splitter Components exist
- Believes he can "remake" reality to eliminate war, poverty, suffering
- Gathered cult of followers (The Unbound)
- Sees both kingdoms as obstacles to better world
- Genuinely believes his plan will save humanity

**Motivation:**
- End suffering through restructuring reality
- Use World-Splitter Components to create "perfect" world
- Destroy old systems (monarchies AND democracies)
- Establish benevolent centralized control
- Sees himself as architect of utopia
- Blind to what he might destroy in the process

---

### **Corvus'S Pitch**

**Read Aloud:**

> *He spreads a map—not of current Tirvandor, but of something else. Ancient. Before the Godsfall.*
>
> *"Both kingdoms are corrupt. Dawnblade serves a tyranny that oppresses millions. Valen serves a democracy that's descending into mob rule. They're not opposites—they're different flavors of failure.*
>
> *But there's a third option. During the Godsfall, when gods fought and shattered reality, they left something behind. Fragments of divine power—the World-Splitter Components.*
>
> *I've spent 30 years researching them. I've found one. Three more remain. With all five, I can use them to... restructure reality. End war. End poverty. End the suffering caused by flawed governments.*
>
> *Imagine a world without kings OR mobs. A world of true order—not Thaldros's oppressive order, but rational, benevolent coordination. Resources distributed fairly. Conflicts resolved peacefully. Everyone fed, housed, safe.*
>
> *That's what I'm building. Join me. Help me find the remaining Components. Help me save humanity from itself."*

**The "contract" he offers is more like a manifesto:**

**The Offer:**
- **Upfront Payment:** 1,000 gold pieces (least of three)
- **Per Mission:** 500-1,000gp + share of recovered artifacts
- **Authority:** None (you're outside the law)
- **Protection:** The Unbound network (underground cells)
- **Post-"War" Rewards:** Position as Wardens in New Order (govern regions)

**The Expectations:**
- Locate and retrieve World-Splitter Components
- Sabotage BOTH kingdoms (neither can win)
- Recruit powerful allies to the cause
- Publicly: "Fighting for freedom from both tyrannies"
- Privately: "Enabling reality restructuring"

---

### **Questions & Answers**

**If PCs ask questions:**

**"You're insane."**
> *"Am I? Look at history. Monarchies oppress. Democracies collapse. Theocracies control. Every system fails because humans are flawed. But what if we could... optimize? Remove the flaws? That's not insanity—that's vision."*

**"What do these Components actually do?"**
> *"They were used by gods during the Godsfall to... alter fundamental reality. Think of reality as a tapestry. The Components allow you to reweave specific threads. With all five, coordinated properly, we can restructure society at a foundational level.*
>
> *No more war—conflict becomes neurologically impossible. No more poverty—resources redistribute automatically. No more tyranny—power structures optimize for collective good."*

**"That sounds like you're removing free will."**
> *(Pauses, considering)*
> *"That's... a philosophical question. Is 'free will' to starve, wage war, and oppress each other truly freedom? Or is it a luxury we can't afford? I'm offering freedom FROM suffering. That's real freedom."*

**"What if you're wrong?"**
> *"Then millions continue suffering under failed systems. At least I'm TRYING to fix it. Dawnblade maintains oppression. Valen enables chaos. I offer actual change. Which is most moral?"*

**Insight DC 16:**
- Corvus is absolutely sincere
- He's brilliant but potentially delusional
- He genuinely believes he's saving the world
- He's aware using Components might kill millions
- He considers it acceptable cost for "perfect" future
- He's charismatic cult leader who believes own rhetoric

**Persuasion DC 18 (to get him to reveal the cost):**
> *"You want to know the truth? Using all five Components will... disrupt reality temporarily. The restructuring process might kill... 10-20% of population. Maybe 30%.*
>
> *That's millions dead. I'm aware. I've done the calculations. I've spent three years agonizing over this decision.*
>
> *But if we DON'T act? Wars kill millions over decades. Poverty kills millions over centuries. I'm offering to save billions at the cost of millions. That's... that's utilitarian calculus.*
>
> *I don't LIKE it. But I'll do it. Because someone has to make hard choices."*

---

### **Corvus'S Secret Agenda**

**What he's NOT telling PCs:**

1. **The Cost:** Actually 30-40% fatality rate (he's minimizing)
2. **Free Will:** Components WILL remove free will in restructured reality
3. **Permanence:** Effect is permanent—no going back
4. **His Instability:** Proximity to Component #1 is affecting his sanity
5. **The Unbound:** Some followers are extremists who want chaos, not utopia

**This information revealed later in Quest 2.3 (The Double Cross)**

---

## The Investigation Phase

**After meeting all three:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *Three offers. Three visions. Three futures.*
>
> *Dawnblade offers gold and order through tyranny. Valen offers ideals and chaos through democracy. Corvus offers transformation through apocalypse.*
>
> *You have three days to decide. All three recruiters made that clear—this opportunity won't wait forever. War is coming. Choose a side. Or try to play them all.*

---

### **Gathering Information**

**PCs can investigate all three factions before committing.**

**Suggested Activities:**

1. **Talk to NPCs from Act I**
   - Varak or Kael (guild leader): What do they think?
   - Mira (info broker): What rumors has she heard?
   - NPCs from previous quests: Which side did they choose?

2. **Research the Factions**
   - History checks about Thaldros
   - Investigation checks about Aethoria
   - Arcana checks about World-Splitter Components

3. **Observe Faction Actions**
   - Follow Dawnblade's soldiers
   - Watch Valen meet with contacts
   - Investigate Unbound hideout

---

### **Information Gathering Results**

**About Thaldros (History DC 15):**
- Kingdom has ruled 500+ years
- Stable but oppressive
- Efficient bureaucracy
- Common folk have little freedom but relative safety
- Recent decades: increasing corruption
- Marcus Blackwood case (if PCs know about it) is example of injustice

**About Aethoria (History DC 14):**
- Republic formed 80 years ago through revolution
- Democratic but unstable
- Mob rule common
- Amazing cultural output (art, science)
- Recent years: increasing corruption and faction fighting
- Many senators as corrupt as monarchs

**About the Unbound (Arcana DC 16):**
- Cult formed 10 years ago
- Led by Corvus Blackwood (scholar-turned-prophet)
- Obsessed with Godsfall artifacts
- Growing membership (2,000+ followers)
- Some members genuinely idealistic
- Others are apocalyptic extremists
- World-Splitter Components are REAL and DANGEROUS

---

### **Talking TO Act I Npcs**

**If PCs ask Varak (or Kael):**

**Varak (Iron Guild):**
> *"Thaldros. Always Thaldros. Order beats chaos every time. Aethoria's democracy is mob rule. And The Unbound? Cult nonsense. Take Dawnblade's gold and help maintain civilization."*

**Kael (Black Chains):**
> *"Play all three if you can. Get paid by everyone. When the war ends, whoever wins will need mercenaries. Loyalty is for soldiers. We're businessmen."*

**Mira (Info Broker):**
> *"Here's what I know: Dawnblade is honorable but following dishonorable orders. Valen is genuine but naive. Corvus is brilliant but insane. Pick your poison."*

**PCs from Quest 1.5 (if relevant):**

**If helped Marcus Blackwood:**
> *(Letter from Marcus, now in exile)*
> *"If you're reading this, war has begun. I urge you: side with Aethoria. Thaldros proved its injustice when it tried to silence me. Democracy is flawed, but it's our only hope against tyranny."*

**If delivered Marcus to trial:**
> *(Crown officials remember you favorably)*
> *"The crown appreciates your service. Commander Dawnblade has been instructed to offer you premium compensation."*

---

## The Choice

**After investigation, PCs must choose (or try to delay):**

### **Option 1: JOIN THALDROS**

**What You Get:**
- 2,500gp upfront (deposited immediately)
- Royal authority (legal backing)
- Political connections

## DM Guidance

### **Running the Three Meetings**

**Pacing:**
- Each meeting should take 30-45 minutes
- Let players ask questions
- Don't rush the decision
- This choice affects entire Act II

**Presenting Fairly:**
- Make all three appealing in different ways
- Don't telegraph "correct" choice
- All have valid arguments
- All have hidden flaws

**Player Agency:**
- Some players will choose quickly
- Some will agonize
- Both are valid
- Don't force a choice until they're ready

### **If Players Try to Delay**

**All three recruiters give 3-day deadline:**

> *"War waits for no one. Three days. Then we find other mercenaries."*

**After 3 days:**
- Offers expire (can still work freelance but no bonuses)
- Other mercenary groups are hired
- War begins without them

### **If Players Can't Agree**

**Party may split:**
- Some join Thaldros
- Some join Aethoria
- Some go independent
- This is VALID and creates interesting dynamics
- Campaign continues with divided party (harder but doable)

### **The "Right" Choice**

**There isn't one.**

- Thaldros offers stability through oppression
- Aethoria offers freedom through chaos
- Unbound offers transformation through apocalypse
- All are morally grey
- Let players decide what matters to them

---
