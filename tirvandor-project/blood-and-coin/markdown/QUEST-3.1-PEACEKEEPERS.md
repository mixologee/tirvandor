## Act III Opening

**Time:** One year after Act II finale

**The State of the World:**

You achieved the impossible in Act II—you stopped the war. You exposed the conspiracy, forced both kingdoms to the negotiating table, and brokered the Treaty of Judgment Border.

But peace is fragile. Daily.

**Read Aloud:**

> *One year has passed since you prevented the war. The Treaty of Judgment Border holds—barely.*
>
> *The frontier territories exist in uneasy peace with the Crown. Trade resumed. Prisoners exchanged. Diplomatic relations established. From the outside, it looks like peace.*
>
> *From the inside? You know better. You're the official Peacekeepers—neutral mediators appointed by both kingdoms. Every week brings new crises. Border disputes. Trade disagreements. Assassination attempts. Diplomatic incidents.*
>
> *You prevent them. One crisis at a time. One day at a time. It's exhausting.*
>
> *But today is worse than usual. Three separate incidents. Same day. All threatening to reignite the war.*
>
> *This is your life now. Welcome to Level 11. Welcome to Act III.*

## The Three Crises

**All three occur simultaneously. PCs must prioritize:**

---

## Crisis 1: The Border Incident

**Location:** Judgment Border Checkpoint

**What Happened:**

Thaldros guards killed an Aethoria merchant they claim was smuggling weapons. Aethoria says he was unarmed, carrying legal trade goods. Both sides mobilizing troops.

### **Arrival**

**Read Aloud:**

> *You arrive at the border checkpoint to find 50 Thaldros soldiers on one side, 40 Aethoria militia on the other. The dead merchant's body lies in no-man's-land. No one will retrieve it—crossing the line might spark violence.*
>
> *Thaldros Captain: "He was smuggling swords! We have every right to enforce border security!"*
>
> *Aethoria Lieutenant: "You murdered an unarmed civilian! This is an act of war!"*
>
> *Weapons drawn. Fingers on triggers. One wrong word and this explodes.*

---

### **Investigation**

**PCs can investigate the scene:**

**Perception DC 16 (examining body from distance):**
> *The merchant has no visible weapons. His cart contains... textiles? Cloth bolts. No swords visible.*

**Medicine DC 14:**
> *Crossbow bolt to the back. He was fleeing, not attacking.*

**Investigation DC 17 (examining cart closely):**
> *Hidden compartment. Empty. But residue suggests swords WERE here recently. Someone removed them.*

**Insight DC 15 (reading soldiers):**
> *Thaldros captain looks nervous. He's hiding something. Aethoria lieutenant is genuinely enraged—believes merchant was innocent.*

---

### **The TRUTH**

**If PCs investigate thoroughly:**

**Perception DC 18 (searching area):**
> *Fresh wagon tracks leading away from checkpoint. Someone else was here. Recently.*

**Survival DC 16 (tracking):**
> *Tracks lead to nearby woods. You find: abandoned cart with 20 swords. Thaldros military issue.*

**The Truth:**
- Merchant WAS smuggling (Thaldros correct)
- BUT Thaldros guards PLANTED the swords (framed him)
- Then killed him when he discovered the frame job
- Third party (unknown) removed evidence to hide the setup

**Someone wanted this incident to spark war.**

---

### **The RESOLUTION**

**PCs must decide:**

**Option 1: Expose Thaldros Frame Job**
- Confront Thaldros captain with evidence
- Public admission of murder
- Thaldros embarrassed but truth revealed
- **Persuasion DC 18** to get captain to confess

**If successful:**
- Thaldros apologizes formally
- Captain arrested
- Aethoria satisfied
- Peace holds
- **Reward:** Reputation +5 with Aethoria, +2 with Thaldros (transparency)

**If failed:**
- Thaldros denies everything
- Both sides stay angry
- Tension remains high

---

**Option 2: Blame Third Party**
- Present evidence of unknown wagon
- Suggest someone framed BOTH sides
- Shift anger toward mutual enemy
- **Persuasion DC 16** (easier, shared enemy unites)

**If successful:**
- Both sides agree to joint investigation
- Cooperation instead of confrontation
- Peace holds
- But truth remains hidden
- **Reward:** Reputation +3 with both kingdoms

---

**Option 3: Peaceful Lie**
- Claim merchant was innocent, hide evidence
- Demand Thaldros compensate family
- Political solution, not truth
- **Deception DC 18**

**If successful:**
- Thaldros pays blood money
- Aethoria satisfied
- Peace holds
- But Thaldros resentful
- **Reward:** Reputation +5 Aethoria, -2 Thaldros

---

**Option 4: Escalate**
- Refuse to mediate
- Let them fight it out
- **This breaks the peace**
- Fail quest, war resumes

---

## Crisis 2: The Trade Dispute

**Location:** Port City of Seahaven (neutral ground)

**What Happened:**

Aethoria merchant ship seized by Thaldros navy for "illegal goods." Aethoria demands release. Thaldros refuses. Both threaten embargo.

### **The SITUATION**

**Read Aloud:**

> *Seahaven Port. The merchant ship "Liberty's Call" sits anchored, Thaldros navy blockading it. Aethoria diplomats argue with Thaldros admirals on the dock. Merchants on both sides watching nervously—if trade stops, everyone loses money.*
>
> *Thaldros Admiral: "The ship carries Unbound propaganda. Books. Pamphlets. Cult materials. We can't allow that poison into our kingdom."*
>
> *Aethoria Diplomat: "Freedom of speech! We don't censor! Release the ship or we close ALL trade!"*
>
> *Merchant guilds are panicking. If trade stops, both economies suffer. But neither side will back down.*

---

### **Investigation**

**Persuasion DC 15 to board the ship:**

**What PCs find:**
- 200 crates of legitimate trade goods
- 5 crates of books (Unbound philosophy)
- Books are: Critical of monarchy AND democracy
- Call for "new order" (Corvus-style rhetoric)
- NOT illegal in Aethoria (free speech)
- VERY illegal in Thaldros (sedition)

**Investigation DC 16:**
> *The books were loaded by someone named "Brother Ash"—Unbound member. He's listed as passenger, not crew.*

**Insight DC 14:**
> *This isn't about the books. Thaldros wants excuse to flex power. Aethoria wants excuse to resist. Both testing the treaty.*

---

### **The TRUTH**

**If PCs dig deeper:**

**Investigation DC 18 (ship manifest):**
> *Brother Ash paid 500gp to load books. Ship captain didn't know contents. He's innocent. Books were smuggled aboard.*

**Unbound are testing the peace.** If kingdoms fight over books, war resumes. Unbound wins.

---

### **The RESOLUTION**

**Option 1: Confiscate Books, Release Ship**
- Compromise: Remove illegal cargo, release ship
- Neither side wins completely
- **Persuasion DC 16** to get both to agree

**If successful:**
- Trade continues
- Thaldros gets security
- Aethoria maintains trade
- Peace holds
- **Reward:** Reputation +3 both kingdoms

---

**Option 2: Defend Free Speech**
- Argue books are legal in international waters
- Force Thaldros to release ship
- **Persuasion DC 18** (harder, challenges Thaldros authority)

**If successful:**
- Ship released with books
- Aethoria celebrates victory
- Thaldros resentful
- Peace holds but strained
- **Reward:** Reputation +5 Aethoria, -3 Thaldros

---

**Option 3: Support Seizure**
- Agree books are dangerous
- Ship stays seized
- **Persuasion DC 17** (need to convince Aethoria)

**If successful:**
- Thaldros keeps ship
- Aethoria backs down
- Peace holds but strained
- **Reward:** Reputation +5 Thaldros, -3 Aethoria

---

**Option 4: Expose Unbound Plot**
- Reveal Brother Ash smuggled books
- Frame as Unbound sabotage
- Unite kingdoms against shared enemy
- **Investigation DC 17 to find Brother Ash**

**If successful:**
- Both kingdoms cooperate
- Hunt Unbound together
- Peace strengthened
- **Reward:** Reputation +5 both kingdoms
- **Bonus:** Lead to Brother Ash (can arrest/question)

---

## Crisis 3: The Assassination Attempt

**Location:** Diplomatic Summit (neutral ground)

**What Happened:**

Someone tried to assassinate Envoy Valen during peace summit. Aethoria blames Thaldros. Thaldros denies it. Summit collapsing.

### **The SCENE**

**Read Aloud:**

> *You arrive at the summit building to chaos. Envoy Valen is alive—barely. Crossbow bolt missed his heart by inches. He's conscious, bleeding, furious.*
>
> *Valen: "Thaldros tried to kill me! So much for peace!"*
>
> *Commander Dawnblade: "We did NO such thing! This is a frame job!"*
>
> *Security found the assassin's position—rooftop across street. Bolt is Thaldros military issue. Valen's guards want blood. Dawnblade's honor guards are defensive. Violence is imminent unless you stop it.*

---

### **Investigation**

**Perception DC 15 (examining bolt):**
> *Thaldros military crossbow bolt. Standard issue. Available to thousands of soldiers.*

**Investigation DC 17 (examining rooftop):**
> *Sniper position well-chosen. Professional. But... something's off. The angle is wrong. Bolt should have killed Valen easily. This shooter either missed badly or missed on purpose.*

**Medicine DC 16 (examining Valen's wound):**
> *Bolt trajectory suggests deliberate near-miss. One inch right and Valen dies. This wasn't incompetence—it was precision missing.*

**Investigation DC 18 (rooftop evidence):**
> *Boot prints. Military boots. Size 10. Also: black fabric thread caught on roof tile. Not Thaldros colors—that's Unbound black.*

---

### **The TRUTH**

**The assassin was Unbound, not Thaldros.**

They used Thaldros equipment to frame them. Deliberately missed Valen (wanted to wound, not kill—dead martyr less useful than angry victim). Goal: Reignite war.

**If PCs find Brother Ash from Crisis 2:** He knows about assassin. Can be interrogated.

---

### **The RESOLUTION**

**Option 1: Blame Thaldros**
- Present bolt as evidence
- Demand Thaldros accountability
- **Persuasion DC 16** (Valen wants this)

**If successful:**
- Thaldros apologizes (even though innocent)
- Pays reparations
- Peace holds but resentment grows
- **Reward:** Reputation +5 Aethoria, -5 Thaldros
- **Long-term:** Thaldros eventually discovers truth, furious at injustice

---

**Option 2: Prove Frame Job**
- Present evidence of Unbound involvement
- Show deliberate near-miss
- **Investigation DC 18 to convince both sides**

**If successful:**
- Both kingdoms realize they're being manipulated
- Joint task force against Unbound
- Peace strengthened
- **Reward:** Reputation +5 both kingdoms
- **Bonus:** Hunt for Unbound begins (Quest 3.2 setup)

---

**Option 3: Cover-Up**
- Claim assassin died escaping
- No one to blame
- Move past incident
- **Deception DC 19** (very hard, Valen suspicious)

**If successful:**
- No blame assigned
- Summit continues
- Peace holds
- But mystery remains
- **Reward:** Reputation +2 both (neither fully satisfied)

---

**Option 4: Independent Investigation**
- Demand time to investigate properly
- Delay judgment
- **Persuasion DC 17** to get both sides to wait

**If successful:**
- 1 day to investigate
- Can find more evidence
- Better resolution possible
- But risky (tempers high)

---

## The Pattern

**If PCs investigate all three crises thoroughly:**

**Insight DC 17:**
> *These aren't coincidences. Same day. All designed to provoke war. Someone's coordinating this.*

**Investigation DC 18 (connecting evidence):**
> *Brother Ash connected to two incidents. Unbound black fabric at assassination. The hidden cart from border incident had Unbound symbols scratched inside.*

**The Revelation:**

**The Unbound are sabotaging the peace.**

Corvus (if alive) or Unbound remnants are deliberately creating incidents to restart war. Why? Chaos serves their goals.

**This sets up Quest 3.2: The Underground**

---

## Aftermath

**End of session:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *You handled three crises in one day. Three potential wars prevented. Three diplomatic victories (or compromises, or failures—depending on choices).*
>
> *But as you return to your quarters, exhausted, you realize: This is your life now. Every day. Every week. The peace doesn't maintain itself. It requires constant, thankless, exhausting work.*
>
> *And someone's actively trying to break it.*
>
> *(A messenger arrives with three more urgent dispatches)*
>
> *"More incidents. Northern border. Western trade route. Southern diplomatic mission. All need Peacekeeper intervention."*
>
> *Welcome to Act III. This is what you earned in Act II. The privilege of defending what you built.*

---

## DM Guidance

### **Running Multiple Crises**

**Don't make PCs solve all simultaneously:**
- They prioritize (which matters most?)
- Delegate (can send allies to handle one)
- Accept imperfect solutions

**Time Pressure:**
- Each crisis has deadline
- Can't perfectly solve all
- Forces hard choices

### **The Investigation Layer**

**Reward thorough investigation:**
- Pattern emerges if they look
- Unbound connection is findable
- Sets up Act III villain

**But don't require it:**
- Can resolve crises without seeing pattern
- Just makes Quest 3.2 harder

### **Peace is Hard**

**This quest establishes theme:**
- Peace requires constant work
- Both sides need maintenance
- No victory, just daily survival
- This is the "good" ending they earned
- But "good" doesn't mean "easy"

---

## Transition to QUEST 3.2

**After resolving crises:**

**Read Aloud:**

> *You've bought peace another day. Maybe another week. But the incidents continue. And now you know: The Unbound are behind them.*
>
> *Corvus may be dead (or imprisoned, or in hiding). But his followers remain. Cells throughout both kingdoms. True believers who think war serves their goals.*
>
> *Quest 3.2: Hunt the Unbound. Root out the saboteurs. Before they succeed in breaking what you built.*
