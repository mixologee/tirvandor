- Charismatic despite circumstances - inspires loyalty

**Ideals:**
- **Justice:** "House Thandris destroyed my family. They will answer for it."
- **Legacy:** "House Blackwood will rise again, or I'll die trying."
- **Redemption:** "Our name was sullied. I'll restore it or destroy those who took it."

**Bonds:**
- The memory of his family (parents executed, estates seized)
- His younger sibling (the Lost Heir, hidden somewhere safe)
- Those who've helped him survive (small network of allies)
- The Blackwood family sigil (tattoo on his back, all he has left)

**Flaws:**
- Obsessed with revenge against House Thandris
- Paranoid - sees betrayal everywhere
- Pushes people away to protect them (and himself)
- Willing to sacrifice almost anything to restore his house

### Background & History
Lord Shadows Blackwood was born Aldric Blackwood in 1205 CR to a powerful noble house. He had everything - wealth, title, family, future. Then, in 1228 CR (when he was 23), it ended.

House Blackwood was accused of treason - conspiracy against King Aldric III Thandris. The charges were serious: attempting to assassinate the king, plotting to seize the throne, working with foreign enemies. House Thandris moved swiftly.

The trial was quick. His parents were executed. The estates were seized. The family name was declared forfeit. Young Aldric barely escaped with his life and his 5-year-old sibling. He gave his sibling to trusted friends to hide, then fled into exile.

For 19 years, he's lived as a ghost. "Lord Shadows" is what survivors call him - the shadow of House Blackwood, refusing to die. He's learned skills no noble should know - assassination, theft, forgery, poison. He's built a network of those wronged by the powerful.

He's investigated his family's fall obsessively. He's uncovered inconsistencies, contradictions, evidence of framing. He's become convinced his parents were innocent - or at least, that the trial was a sham. House Thandris wanted their lands and power.

Now, at 42, he's preparing his revenge. He's gathered allies, resources, evidence. Soon, he'll act. Either House Blackwood rises from ashes, or he dies trying.

### Connections
- **The Lost Heir:** His younger sibling (gender undetermined, now 24), hidden with false identity
- **Enemy:** House Thandris (especially King Aldric IV, who he blames for perpetuating injustice)
- **Ally:** Lady Morgana Blackwater (provides intelligence, resources, for price)
- **Contact:** Master Crimson (The Syndicate) - uneasy alliance
- **Friend:** Those he's saved from similar injustices (growing network)
- **Mentor:** An old assassin who taught him survival (deceased, but legacy remains)

### Secrets
1. **The Heir's Location:** The Lost Heir is hidden in Silverpine as a scholar named "Elowen Gray." They have no memory of being Blackwood - Shadows used magic to suppress it for their protection. Restoring memory is possible but dangerous.

2. **The Evidence:** Shadows has proof House Blackwood was framed - forged documents, false witnesses, planted evidence. But the proof also shows who really did what his family was accused of. The real conspirator is someone currently in power.

3. **The Assassination List:** He's compiled a list of 12 people who must die to restore House Blackwood. King Aldric IV is on it, along with judges, witnesses, and conspirators. He's crossed off three names already. No one suspects they're connected.

4. **The Thandris Secret:** Through his investigations, Shadows discovered a dark secret about House Thandris - evidence of a crime that would destroy them politically. He's keeping it as leverage or weapon, depending on circumstances.

5. **The True Motivation:** Despite revenge talk, Shadows doesn't actually want his house restored through violence. He wants justice - the truth exposed, his family exonerated, those responsible punished. But he'll accept revenge if justice is impossible.

6. **The Vulnerability:** Shadows is dying. Slow-acting poison (side effect of his work) is killing him. He has maybe 5 years. This desperation drives his timeline. He needs to act soon or die knowing he failed.

### Plot Hooks
1. **The Recruitment:** Shadows approaches the party with a job - infiltrate a noble estate and steal evidence. Good pay, simple work. But the evidence relates to House Blackwood's fall, and the party must decide whose side they're on.

2. **The Assassination:** An assassination occurs - a noble involved in House Blackwood's trial. Evidence points to Shadows. The party must find him before authorities do. When they catch him, he reveals he didn't do it - someone's framing him again.

3. **The Heir's Discovery:** The party encounters Elowen Gray in Silverpine. Through investigation, they realize this is the Lost Heir. Do they tell Shadows? Tell Elowen? Keep the secret? Each choice has consequences.

4. **The Evidence Exchange:** Shadows offers the party his proof of House Blackwood's innocence and House Thandris's dark secret - in exchange for help with revenge. They must choose between justice, revenge, or maintaining stability.

5. **The Dying Request:** Shadows is captured and mortally wounded. With his dying breath, he asks the party to find his sibling, reveal the truth, and restore House Blackwood. They inherit his evidence, his contacts, and his quest.

6. **The Alliance:** King Aldric IV secretly approaches the party - he knows Shadows is targeting him. He offers to help prove House Blackwood's innocence if they stop Shadows's assassination attempts. Is this genuine or manipulation?

### Roleplaying Notes
- **Voice:** Quiet, controlled, rarely raised but commanding attention
- **Mannerisms:** Constantly watching exits, never sits with back to door, touches weapons when nervous
- **Catchphrase:** "Justice deferred is justice denied."
- **When stressed:** Becomes colder, more distant, eyes go flat
- **In combat:** Efficient, lethal, no mercy for those he deems guilty

### Notable Dialogue
- *"They took everything. Name, family, future. But they gave me purpose."*
- *"I'm not a villain. I'm an accountant, and the bill is due."*
- *To allies:* "Trust is expensive. I've paid that price. Have you?"*
- *About Thandris:* "They wear crowns built on graves. Time someone reminded them."*
- *When questioned:* "You want truth? Truth is dangerous. Sure you can handle it?"*

### Notes for DMs
- Shadows is designed as morally complex NPC - victim seeking justice/revenge
- He's the "fallen noble turned assassin" archetype
- Can serve as quest-giver, ally, antagonist, or tragic figure
- His secrets provide major political intrigue hooks for levels 10-18
- Works for campaigns exploring justice vs. revenge themes
- The dying timeline adds urgency to his plots
- Perfect for political intrigue and moral gray area campaigns
- Can be sympathetic villain or antihero depending on party alignment
- His relationship with the Lost Heir creates emotional stakes
- Can be saved/redeemed or become tragic fallen hero
