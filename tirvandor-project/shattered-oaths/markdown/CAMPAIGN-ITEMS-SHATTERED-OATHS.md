**Rarity:** Legendary  
**Requires Attunement:** Yes  
**Weight:** -  
**Value:** 50,000+ gp

**Description:**  
A skull of a black raven carved from obsidian, eyes set with rubies. Worn on a silver chain. This was Lord Shadows Blackwood's pact focus, connecting him to the Primordial entity he served. Despite its dark origins, the amulet is simply a tool - its morality determined by its wielder.

**Lore:**  
Crafted by Corvus Blackwood when he made his pact with a Primordial entity of destruction. The raven skull contains a fragment of that entity's essence, granting immense protective and spatial powers.

**Mechanical Properties:**

- **Mind Shield:** You are immune to divination magic and effects that would sense your emotions or thoughts
- **Primordial Sight:** You have darkvision out to 120 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 120 feet.

**Active Powers:**
- **Dimension Door (3 charges):** As an action, expend 1 charge to cast *Dimension Door* (no components required). The amulet regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.
- **Shadow Step:** Once per short rest, as a bonus action, you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is in dim light or darkness.
- **Primordial Ward:** When you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to gain resistance to that damage type until the start of your next turn. Once used, this property cannot be used again until the next dawn.

**Curse (Optional for DMs):**  
The amulet whispers to its wearer during long rests, showing visions of injustice and corruption. Make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw after each long rest. On a failure, you become convinced that systematic change requires drastic action. The curse can be removed by *Remove Curse* cast at 7th level or higher.

**Destruction:**  
The amulet can only be destroyed by exposing it to divine radiant energy from three different gods simultaneously, or by submerging it in Primordial essence at the exact location of a Sundering event.
