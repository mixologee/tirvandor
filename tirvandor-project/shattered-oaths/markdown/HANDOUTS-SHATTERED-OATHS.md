# ⚔️ SHATTERED OATHS CAMPAIGN HANDOUTS

## 13. PROPHECY FRAGMENT #1 (READABLE VERSION)

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════
  THE PROPHECY OF THE SHATTERED WORLD
        Fragment One of Three
    (Found in Great Temple Archives)
═══════════════════════════════════════════

When shadows rise where light once stood,
When noble blood turns dark for good,
When two made one are torn apart,
The Worldrend's child will claim his heart.

Three fragments whole, three truths revealed,
Three paths to walk, three fates are sealed.
The world was split by hand of man,
And man alone can heal what ran.

Beware the crow with raven's call,
His justice pure will doom us all.
The innocent shall pay the price,
Unless the oath is spoken twice.

[Ancient elven runes below, untranslatable]
[Weathered stone, cracked down the middle]
[Dated: Pre-Worldrend Era]

## 15. LETTER FROM CORVUS (BEFORE HE BECAME LORD SHADOWS)

```
My Dearest Sister Elara,

They came for us at dawn.

Father tried to explain. Mother pleaded our
innocence. It did not matter. The Crown had
decided. We were traitors. We were villains.
We were to be erased.

I watched them burn our home. I watched them
tear down our banners. I watched them execute
our household staff for the crime of serving
us.

And I could do nothing.

You are safe, hidden with the elves. Stay
there. Never reveal our name. Live a quiet
life. Forget House Blackwood. Forget Father.
Forget Mother.

Forget me.

I cannot forget. I will not forgive.

They took everything from us. One day, I will
take everything from them.

The world split once before. It can split
again.

Your brother,
Corvus

P.S. - Burn this letter. Do not write back.
       Do not try to find me.
       I am already lost.

[Dated: 1089 CR - 158 years ago]
[Paper yellowed with age]
[Ink faded but legible]
[Small burn marks on edges]
```

**DM Note:** Found in Corvus's lair or revealed by sympathetic NPC. Shows his tragic origin.
