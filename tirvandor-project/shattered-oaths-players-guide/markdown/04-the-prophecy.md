## THE PROPHECY

### THE SHATTERED OATH
An ancient prophecy, found in the Temple of Moira the Weaver:
*"When crowns grow heavy with the weight of chains,*
*When oaths are broken and freedom wanes,*
*Seven shall rise where seven once fell,*
*To break the cycle, to ring freedom's bell.*
*Warrior, Scholar, Healer, Rogue,*
*Mystic, Guardian, and Voice of the Folk,*
*United by purpose, divided by past,*
*The Shattered Oath mended at last.*
*When the Iron Crown cracks at last,*
*When the old order's chains are cast,*
*Seven souls shall light the way,*
- *And freedom's dawn shall break the day."*
What This Means:
- Some believe you're the "Seven" from the prophecy
- Thaldros fears this prophecy (they hunt "prophesied ones")
- Aethoria sees it as hope
- Whether it's real or self-fulfilling is up to you
Prophecy gives you narrative importance but not invincibility
## THE PROPHECY BECKONS
- "Seven shall rise where seven once fell..."
The question is: Are you one of the Seven?
- Or will you make your own destiny?
- Either way, Tirvandor needs heroes.
- Will you answer the call?
**Shattered Oaths Motto:**
- "When the chains of tyranny bind the innocent,
- When hope seems lost and darkness reigns,
- Heroes rise from the ashes of despair,
And freedom's light shall break the chains."
