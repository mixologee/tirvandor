# SHATTERED OATHS: PLAYER'S GUIDE

## CAMPAIGN OVERVIEW

### WHAT IS SHATTERED OATHS?
Shattered Oaths is an epic fantasy campaign about heroes rising to fight tyranny, fulfill an ancient prophecy, and potentially reshape the fate of nations. You play freedom fighters, chosen heroes, or those thrust into greatness, standing against the oppressive might of the Thaldros Empire and championing the cause of liberty.
Core Themes:
Heroism and destiny
Freedom vs. tyranny
Ancient prophecy and fate
Sacrifice and duty
Hope in dark times
Found family and bonds
Campaign Tone:
Epic and inspirational
Morally clear (mostly)
Character-driven drama
High stakes and importance
Medium-high combat, high roleplay, medium exploration

## WHO YOU ARE

### THE CHOSEN (OR THE THRUST-UPON)
You are one of:
THE IDEALIST - You believe in freedom and fight for it willingly
THE RELUCTANT HERO - Circumstances forced you into this, but you'll see it through
THE SEEKING REDEMPTION - Your past haunts you; this is your chance to be better
THE DESTINED - Prophecy speaks of you (or so some believe)
THE LOYALIST - You fight for people/cause you love
What Unites You:
Shared cause (freedom from tyranny)
Belief that things can be better
Willingness to sacrifice for others
Opposition to Thaldros oppression
Destiny (or the appearance thereof)

## THE PROPHECY

### THE SHATTERED OATH
An ancient prophecy, found in the Temple of Moira the Weaver:
> "When crowns grow heavy with the weight of chains,
> When oaths are broken and freedom wanes,
> Seven shall rise where seven once fell,
> To break the cycle, to ring freedom's bell.
>
> Warrior, Scholar, Healer, Rogue,
> Mystic, Guardian, and Voice of the Folk,
> United by purpose, divided by past,
> The Shattered Oath mended at last.
>
> When the Iron Crown cracks at last,
> When the old order's chains are cast,
> Seven souls shall light the way,
> And freedom's dawn shall break the day."
What This Means:
Some believe you're the "Seven" from the prophecy
Thaldros fears this prophecy (they hunt "prophesied ones")
Aethoria sees it as hope
Whether it's real or self-fulfilling is up to you
Prophecy gives you narrative importance but not invincibility

## CHARACTER CREATION GUIDE

One offers to help secretly
Can you trust them?
