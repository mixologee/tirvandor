## THE PROPHECY

### THE SHATTERED OATH
An ancient prophecy, found in the Temple of Moira the Weaver:
> "When crowns grow heavy with the weight of chains,
> When oaths are broken and freedom wanes,
> Seven shall rise where seven once fell,
> To break the cycle, to ring freedom's bell.
>
> Warrior, Scholar, Healer, Rogue,
> Mystic, Guardian, and Voice of the Folk,
> United by purpose, divided by past,
> The Shattered Oath mended at last.
>
> When the Iron Crown cracks at last,
> When the old order's chains are cast,
> Seven souls shall light the way,
> And freedom's dawn shall break the day."
What This Means:
Some believe you're the "Seven" from the prophecy
Thaldros fears this prophecy (they hunt "prophesied ones")
Aethoria sees it as hope
Whether it's real or self-fulfilling is up to you
Prophecy gives you narrative importance but not invincibility
