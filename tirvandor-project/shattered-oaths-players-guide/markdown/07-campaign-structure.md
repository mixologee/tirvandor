## HEROIC CHOICES & CONSEQUENCES

### YOU'RE THE GOOD GUYS (Mostly)
This campaign has clearer morality than Blood & Coin:
Generally Good:
Fighting tyranny ✅
Freeing the oppressed ✅
Protecting innocents ✅
Inspiring hope ✅
Opposing evil ✅
Still Complex:
Collateral Damage - Your actions affect innocents
Resources - Not everyone can be saved
Methods - How far will you go?
Allies - Some resistance members are questionable
Personal Cost - How much will you sacrifice?
Example Dilemmas:
1. The Thaldros Soldiers
Enemy soldiers are conscripts, not evil
Do you kill or spare?
Mercy risks mission failure
2. The Radical Faction
Some resistance members want total war
Civilian casualties "acceptable"
Do you ally with them?
3. The Good Thaldros Official
Not all Thaldros nobles are tyrants
One offers to help secretly
Can you trust them?
4. The Prophecy's Price
Prophecy implies sacrifice
Who will pay the cost?
Can you change fate?
