## ABOUT TIRVANDOR

Tirvandor is a world divided by history, politics, and magic. A catastrophic event known as **The Worldrend** tore the world in two, creating the **Sundering Sea** between two great continents.

**Thaldros** - An authoritarian empire ruled by the Iron Crown, where order and control reign supreme. Military discipline, strict laws, and centralized power define daily life.

**Aethoria** - Free democratic states where personal liberty and self-governance are paramount. Merchant councils, elected leaders, and individual rights shape society.

Between them lies **The Contested Lands** - a lawless border region where neither side holds sway, filled with refugees, mercenaries, and those who've chosen freedom over allegiance.

Magic in Tirvandor flows through **ley lines** - natural channels of energy that crisscross the world. These lines of power make some locations more magically potent than others and tie directly into the world's history.

The choices you make in Tirvandor matter. This is not a world of clear heroes and villains - it's a world where good people make hard decisions, where loyalty is tested, and where your actions have lasting consequences.

---

## A NOTE ON MORALITY

Tirvandor campaigns explore moral complexity and meaningful choice. You may face situations where:

- There is no clear "right" answer
- Good people disagree on the best course of action
- Your character's values conflict with the party's goals
- Choices have unexpected consequences
- Authority figures aren't always trustworthy
- The "enemy" has understandable motivations

This doesn't mean anything goes - heroism, compassion, and standing up for what's right still matter. It means your character will face genuine dilemmas and have to live with their choices.

Talk with your DM and fellow players about the tone and themes of your campaign. Make sure everyone at the table is comfortable with the level of moral complexity in the game.

---

## HOW TO CREATE A CHARACTER

Character creation in Tirvandor follows the standard D&D 5e process with some Tirvandor-specific flavor added. The full step-by-step process is covered in Chapter 2, but here's the quick overview:

**Step 1: Choose a Race**  
Select from nine standard fantasy races (Chapter 3), each with cultural context for how they fit into Tirvandor society.

**Step 2: Choose a Class**  
Pick one of twelve adventuring classes (Chapter 4) that defines your character's abilities and role in combat.

**Step 3: Determine Ability Scores**  
Roll or assign scores to your six core abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.

**Step 4: Describe Your Character**  
Choose a background (Chapter 5), personality traits, and physical appearance. Give your character depth and history.

**Step 5: Choose Equipment**  
Select starting gear and weapons (Chapter 6) based on your class and background.

**Step 6: Come Together**  
Work with your party to establish relationships and shared goals. Decide why you're adventuring together.

Once your character is created, you're ready to play!

# CHAPTER 1: STEP-BY-STEP CHARACTERS
}}


## CHARACTER CREATION OVERVIEW

Your first step in playing an adventurer in Tirvandor is to imagine and create a character of your own. Your character is a combination of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your imagination.

**The process has six steps:**

1. **Choose a Race:** Human, dwarf, elf, or another fantasy species
2. **Choose a Class:** Fighter, wizard, cleric, or another adventuring profession
3. **Determine Ability Scores:** Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma
4. **Describe Your Character:** Physical appearance, personality, background
5. **Choose Equipment:** Weapons, armor, gear, and starting gold
6. **Come Together:** Connect with your party

**Record everything on a character sheet.** See Appendix C for blank sheet.

---

## STEP 1: CHOOSE A RACE

Every character belongs to a race, one of the many intelligent humanoid species in Tirvandor. The most common races are humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Some races have subraces, such as mountain dwarf or wood elf.

**Chapter 2 provides detailed information on these races:**
- Humans
- Dwarves (Hill, Mountain)
- Elves (High, Wood, Dark)
- Halflings (Lightfoot, Stout)
- Dragonborn
- Gnomes (Forest, Rock)
- Half-Elves
- Half-Orcs
- Tieflings

**Your race choice gives you:**
- **Ability Score Increase:** Racial bonus to one or more ability scores
- **Size:** Small or Medium
- **Speed:** How far you move in a round
- **Special Traits:** Darkvision, skill proficiencies, resistances, etc.

**In Tirvandor context:**
Your race also determines how NPCs may react to you. See Chapter 2 for cultural notes on each race in Tirvandor society.

---

## STEP 2: CHOOSE A CLASS

Every adventurer is a member of a class. Class broadly describes a character's vocation, special talents, and tactics.

**Chapter 3 provides detailed information on these classes:**
- Barbarian (Primal warrior)
- Bard (Inspiring musician and jack-of-all-trades)
- Cleric (Priestly divine caster)
- Druid (Nature priest and shapeshifter)
- Fighter (Master of martial combat)
- Monk (Martial artist)
- Paladin (Holy warrior with divine oaths)
- Ranger (Wilderness warrior)
- Rogue (Scoundrel with stealth and precision)
- Sorcerer (Innate magic)
- Warlock (Pact magic from otherworldly patron)
- Wizard (Scholarly magic)

**Your class gives you:**
- **Hit Points:** How much damage you can take
- **Proficiencies:** Armor, weapons, saves, skills, tools
- **Equipment:** Starting gear
- **Class Features:** Special abilities (spellcasting, rage, etc.)

**Level 1 is just the beginning.** As you gain experience, your class determines your capabilities at higher levels.

---

## STEP 3: DETERMINE ABILITY SCORES

Much of what your character does depends on six abilities:

**Strength (STR):** Physical power  
**Dexterity (DEX):** Agility and reflexes  
**Constitution (CON):** Endurance  
**Intelligence (INT):** Reasoning and memory  
**Wisdom (WIS):** Awareness and intuition  
**Charisma (CHA):** Force of personality  

**Ability Score Summary:**

| Score | Modifier | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | -5 | Severely limited |
| 2-3 | -4 | Greatly impaired |
| 4-5 | -3 | Significantly below average |
| 6-7 | -2 | Below average |
| 8-9 | -1 | Slightly below average |
| 10-11 | +0 | Average human |
| 12-13 | +1 | Slightly above average |
| 14-15 | +2 | Above average |
| 16-17 | +3 | Significantly above average |
| 18-19 | +4 | Exceptional |
| 20-21 | +5 | Legendary |


#### METHOD 1: STANDARD ARRAY

**Most balanced and fair method.**

Use these six numbers: **15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8**

Assign them to your six abilities in any order you prefer.

**Example:** Fighter wants high STR and CON
- Strength: 15
- Dexterity: 13
- Constitution: 14
- Intelligence: 8
- Wisdom: 10
- Charisma: 12

Then apply racial bonuses (Step 1).

---


#### METHOD 2: POINT BUY

**Customizable method for optimization.**

**You have 27 points to spend.**

**Ability Score Costs:**

| Score | Point Cost |
|-------|-----------|
| 8 | 0 |
| 9 | 1 |
| 10 | 2 |
| 11 | 3 |
| 12 | 4 |
| 13 | 5 |
| 14 | 7 |
| 15 | 9 |

**Rules:**
- No score lower than 8 or higher than 15 before racial bonuses
- Calculate total cost, must equal 27 points
- Apply racial bonuses after point buy

**Example:** Wizard wants high INT
- Strength: 8 (0 points)
- Dexterity: 14 (7 points)
- Constitution: 14 (7 points)
- Intelligence: 15 (9 points)
- Wisdom: 10 (2 points)
- Charisma: 10 (2 points)
- **Total: 27 points**

Then apply racial bonuses.

---


#### METHOD 3: ROLLING

**Random and exciting method. DM must approve.**

**Roll 4d6, drop lowest, six times.**

1. Roll 4d6 (four six-sided dice)
2. Remove the lowest die
3. Add the three remaining dice
4. Record the total
5. Repeat five more times
6. Assign the six totals to abilities in any order

**Example rolls:**
- Roll: 4, 6, 5, 2 → Drop 2 → Total: 15
- Roll: 3, 6, 6, 1 → Drop 1 → Total: 15
- Roll: 5, 4, 3, 4 → Drop 3 → Total: 13
- Roll: 2, 3, 5, 6 → Drop 2 → Total: 14
- Roll: 4, 3, 2, 4 → Drop 2 → Total: 11
- Roll: 1, 3, 4, 4 → Drop 1 → Total: 11

Results: 15, 15, 14, 13, 11, 11

Then apply racial bonuses.

---


#### VARIANT: CUSTOMIZING ABILITY SCORES (OPTIONAL)

**Tasha's Cauldron of Everything optional rule:**

Your DM may allow you to reassign racial ability score increases.

**Instead of fixed racial bonuses:**
- Assign +2 to one ability
- Assign +1 to another ability
- Or three +1 bonuses

**Example:** Dragonborn traditionally gets +2 STR, +1 CHA
- Could instead take +2 INT, +1 WIS for wizard concept

**Check with your DM before using this variant.**

---


#### APPLYING RACIAL BONUSES

After determining base scores, add racial bonuses from your chosen race (Chapter 2).

**Example:** Human Fighter using Standard Array
- Base: STR 15, DEX 13, CON 14, INT 8, WIS 10, CHA 12
- Human bonus: +1 to all abilities
- Final: STR 16, DEX 14, CON 15, INT 9, WIS 11, CHA 13

**Example:** Mountain Dwarf Fighter using Standard Array
- Base: STR 15, DEX 12, CON 14, INT 8, WIS 13, CHA 10
- Dwarf bonus: +2 CON, +2 STR
- Final: STR 17, DEX 12, CON 16, INT 8, WIS 13, CHA 10

---


#### CALCULATING MODIFIERS

Once you have final ability scores, determine modifiers:

**Formula:** (Ability Score - 10) ÷ 2, rounded down

**Or use this table:**

| Score | Modifier | Score | Modifier |
|-------|----------|-------|----------|
| 1 | -5 | 16-17 | +3 |
| 2-3 | -4 | 18-19 | +4 |
| 4-5 | -3 | 20-21 | +5 |
| 6-7 | -2 | 22-23 | +6 |
| 8-9 | -1 | 24-25 | +7 |
| 10-11 | +0 | 26-27 | +8 |
| 12-13 | +1 | 28-29 | +9 |
| 14-15 | +2 | 30 | +10 |

**Write the modifier next to each ability score on your character sheet.**

---

## STEP 4: DESCRIBE YOUR CHARACTER


#### PHYSICAL APPEARANCE

**Choose or roll:**
- **Height and Weight:** See racial descriptions (Chapter 2)
- **Age:** Young adult to middle-aged is typical for adventurers
- **Hair, Eyes, Skin:** Any color appropriate to race

#### ALIGNMENT

**Alignment is a general description of moral and ethical attitudes.**

**Two Axes:**

**Law vs Chaos:**

- **Chaotic:** Values freedom, flexibility, spontaneity

**Good vs Evil:**
- **Good:** Compassionate, altruistic, helps others

**Nine Alignments:**

| | Lawful | Neutral | Chaotic |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|

---

**Option B (Starting Gold):**
- 5d4 × 10 gp (average: 125 gp)
- Buy equipment from Chapter 5


#### ARMOR CLASS (AC)

Your Armor Class represents how hard you are to hit in combat.

**Base AC = 10 + Dexterity modifier**

**With armor:** Use armor's AC (+ Dex modifier if allowed)

**Examples:**
- Unarmored (10 + Dex): Wizard with 14 Dex = AC 12
- Leather armor (11 + Dex): Rogue with 16 Dex = AC 14
- Chain mail (16, no Dex): Fighter = AC 16
- Plate armor (18, no Dex): Paladin = AC 18


#### WEAPONS

Choose weapons from Chapter 5.

**Record on character sheet:**

- Damage (weapon die + ability modifier)

**Example:** Fighter with Longsword
- **Attack:** +5 to hit (proficiency +2, STR modifier +3)
- **Damage:** 1d8+3 slashing (or 1d10+3 versatile two-handed)

---

## STEP 6: COME TOGETHER

- Brought together by patron
- Coincidence turned partnership
- Shared goal or enemy

**What keeps you together?**

**Group dynamics:**
- Who's the face (talks to NPCs)?
- Who's the planner?
- Who's the muscle?
- Who's the scout?
- Who's the healer?

**Don't start as strangers who distrust each other. Start as a functional team, even if recently formed.**


#### CAMPAIGN-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS

**For Blood & Coin (Mercenary Campaign):**
- Why mercenary work?
- What's your reputation goal?
- What won't you do (your line)?
- Why trust this party?

**For Shattered Oaths (Heroic Campaign):**
- What makes you a hero?
- What do you fight for?
- Why answer the call?
- What's your greatest fear?

# CHAPTER 2: RACES
}}


## CHOOSING A RACE

Your character's race determines certain physical characteristics and natural abilities.

**Each racial description includes:**
- **Ability Score Increase:** Bonus to one or more abilities
- **Age:** Typical lifespan
- **Alignment:** Common tendencies (not required)
- **Size:** Small or Medium
- **Speed:** Walking speed in feet per round
- **Traits:** Special abilities (darkvision, resistances, etc.)
- **Languages:** Languages you can speak
- **Subraces:** Variants within the race (if applicable)

**IN TIRVANDOR CONTEXT:**
Each race also includes cultural notes about how they fit Tirvandor society. This affects roleplay but not mechanics.

---

## HUMAN

*"Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races. Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of Tirvandor."*


#### HUMAN TRAITS

**Ability Score Increase:** Your ability scores each increase by 1.

**Age:** Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

**Alignment:** Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and worst are found among them.

**Size:** Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

**Speed:** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Languages:** You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects.


#### VARIANT HUMAN (OPTIONAL)

If your DM allows, you can use the following traits instead:

**Ability Score Increase:** Two different ability scores of your choice increase by 1.

**Skills:** You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice.

**Feat:** You gain one feat of your choice (see Chapter 6).


#### HUMANS IN TIRVANDOR

**Population:** Majority (~60%)  
**Nations:** Dominate both Thaldros and Aethoria  
**Stereotypes:** Ambitious, short-lived, adaptable

**Cultural Context:**
- Most common race in both nations
- No single human culture (varies by region)
- Thaldros humans tend toward law and order
- Aethoria humans tend toward freedom and democracy
- Border humans are pragmatic survivors

**Roleplaying Notes:**
- Fit anywhere without standing out
- No inherent cultural baggage
- Define yourself by choices, not race
- Most versatile option

---

## DWARF

*"Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human."*


#### DWARF TRAITS

**Ability Score Increase:** Your Constitution score increases by 2.

**Age:** Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they're considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years.

**Alignment:** Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play.

**Size:** Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.

**Speed:** Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.

**Darkvision:** Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**Dwarven Resilience:** You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.

**Dwarven Combat Training:** You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and warhammer.

**Tool Proficiency:** You gain proficiency with the artisan's tools of your choice: smith's tools, brewer's supplies, or mason's tools.

**Stonecunning:** Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of stonework, you are considered proficient in the History skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.

**Languages:** You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak.

**Subraces:** Two main subraces exist: hill dwarves and mountain dwarves.


#### HILL DWARF

**Ability Score Increase:** Your Wisdom score increases by 1.

**Dwarven Toughness:** Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.


#### MOUNTAIN DWARF

**Ability Score Increase:** Your Strength score increases by 2.

**Dwarven Armor Training:** You have proficiency with light and medium armor.


#### DWARVES IN TIRVANDOR

**Population:** Common (~15%)  
**Nations:** Respected in both, mountain clans independent  
**Stereotypes:** Stubborn, skilled craftsmen, honor-bound

**Cultural Context:**
- Mountain clans maintain independence in northern ranges
- Hill dwarves integrated into both nations
- Master craftsmen, especially smiths and brewers
- Long memories (never forget grudge or favor)
- **Iron Guild** led by dwarf Varak Ironfist (mercenary hub)

**Roleplaying Notes:**
- Respected professionals in both nations
- Natural fit for military or mercenary work
- Cultural expectation of honor and craftsmanship
- Value strength, skill, and gold

---

## ELF

*"Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light."*


#### ELF TRAITS

**Ability Score Increase:** Your Dexterity score increases by 2.

**Age:** Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.

**Alignment:** Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not.

**Size:** Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.

**Speed:** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Darkvision:** Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**Keen Senses:** You have proficiency in the Perception skill.

**Fey Ancestry:** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.

**Trance:** Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

**Languages:** You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races.

#### HIGH ELF

**Ability Score Increase:** Your Intelligence score increases by 1.

- Dark elves: Rare and deeply distrusted, usually outcasts
- Long lifespan makes them seem detached from "mortal concerns"

- Rare in mercenary work (unusual career choice)
- Magical aptitude respected in both nations

When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one.

### **RAGE**

In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.

While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:
- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
- When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll (see the Barbarian table for the amount).
- You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.

Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.

### **UNARMORED DEFENSE**

While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

### **RECKLESS ATTACK (2ND LEVEL)**

Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.

### **DANGER SENSE (2ND LEVEL)**

At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.

You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.

### **PRIMAL PATH (3RD LEVEL)**

At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior (both detailed at the end of the class description). Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.

### **ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT (4TH, 8TH, 12TH, 16TH, 19TH)**

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Alternatively, you can take a feat (see Chapter 6) if your DM allows.

### **EXTRA ATTACK (5TH LEVEL)**

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### **FAST MOVEMENT (5TH LEVEL)**

Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing heavy armor.

### **FERAL INSTINCT (7TH LEVEL)**

By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.

Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.

### **BRUTAL CRITICAL (9TH, 13TH, 17TH)**

Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.

### **RELENTLESS RAGE (11TH LEVEL)**

Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.

### **PERSISTENT RAGE (15TH LEVEL)**

Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.

### **INDOMITABLE MIGHT (18TH LEVEL)**

Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.

### **PRIMAL CHAMPION (20TH LEVEL)**

At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.

### **PRIMAL PATHS**

#### **PATH OF THE BERSERKER**

For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end—that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood.

**Frenzy (3rd Level)**

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion.

**Mindless Rage (6th Level)**

Beginning at 6th level, you can't be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.

**Intimidating Presence (10th Level)**

Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.

If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.

**Retaliation (14th Level)**

Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.

#### **PATH OF THE TOTEM WARRIOR**

The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, and inspiration.

**Spirit Seeker (3rd Level)**

Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural world, giving you a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level when you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the *beast sense* and *speak with animals* spells, but only as rituals.

**Totem Spirit (3rd Level)**

At 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object—an amulet or similar adornment—that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit.

Your totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but more appropriate to your homeland. For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in place of an eagle.

- **Bear:** While raging, you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage.
- **Eagle:** While you're raging and aren't wearing heavy armor, other creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn.
- **Wolf:** While you're raging, your friends have advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature within 5 feet of you that is hostile to you.

**Aspect of the Beast (6th Level)**

At 6th level, you gain a magical benefit based on the totem animal of your choice.

- **Bear:** You gain the might of a bear. Your carrying capacity (including maximum load and maximum lift) is doubled, and you have advantage on Strength checks made to push, pull, lift, or break objects.
- **Eagle:** You gain the eyesight of an eagle. You can see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty, able to discern even fine details as though looking at something no more than 100 feet away from you. Additionally, dim light doesn't impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Perception) checks.
- **Wolf:** You gain the hunting sensibilities of a wolf. You can track other creatures while traveling at a fast pace, and you can move stealthily while traveling at a normal pace.

**Spirit Walker (10th Level)**

At 10th level, you can cast the *commune with nature* spell, but only as a ritual. When you do so, a spiritual version of one of the animals you chose for Totem Spirit or Aspect of the Beast appears to you to convey the information you seek.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### **ACTION SURGE (2ND LEVEL)**

Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.

### **MARTIAL ARCHETYPE (3RD LEVEL)**

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques. Choose Champion, Battle Master, or Eldritch Knight (all detailed at the end of the class description). The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.

### **ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT (4TH, 6TH, 8TH, 12TH, 14TH, 16TH, 19TH)**

#### **BATTLE MASTER**

Those who emulate the archetypal Battle Master employ martial techniques passed down through generations. To a Battle Master, combat is an academic field, sometimes including subjects beyond battle such as weaponsmithing and calligraphy. Not every fighter absorbs the lessons of history, theory, and artistry that are reflected in the Battle Master archetype, but those who do are well-rounded fighters of great skill and knowledge.

**Combat Superiority (3rd Level)**

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.

**Maneuvers:** You learn three maneuvers of your choice (see "Maneuvers" below). Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack. You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

**Superiority Dice:** You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest. You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.

**Saving Throws:** Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Maneuver save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)

**Student of War (3rd Level)**

At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one type of artisan's tools of your choice.

**Know Your Enemy (7th Level)**

Starting at 7th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:
- Strength score
- Dexterity score
- Constitution score
- Armor Class
- Current hit points
- Total class levels (if any)
- Fighter class levels (if any)

**Improved Combat Superiority (10th Level)**

At 10th level, your superiority dice turn into d10s. At 18th level, they turn into d12s.

**Relentless (15th Level)**

Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and have no superiority dice remaining, you regain one superiority die.

**MANEUVERS**

The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.

**Commander's Strike:** When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks and use a bonus action to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you and expend one superiority die. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack, adding the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

**Disarming Attack:** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.

**Distracting Strike:** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.

**Feinting Attack:** You can expend one superiority die and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet of you as your target. You have advantage on your next attack roll against that creature. If that attack hits, add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

**Goading Attack:** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.

**Lunging Attack:** When you make a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die to increase your reach for that attack by 5 feet. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

**Maneuvering Attack:** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to maneuver one of your comrades into a more advantageous position. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.

**Menacing Attack:** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to frighten the target. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

**Parry:** When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your superiority die + your Dexterity modifier.

**Precision Attack:** When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.

**Pushing Attack:** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to drive the target back. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up to 15 feet away from you.

**Rally:** On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one superiority die to bolster the resolve of one of your companions. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature gains temporary hit points equal to the superiority die roll + your Charisma modifier.

**Riposte:** When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to make a melee weapon attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

**Sweeping Attack:** When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your superiority die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

**Trip Attack:** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to knock the target down. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you knock the target prone.

#### **ELDRITCH KNIGHT**

The archetypal Eldritch Knight combines the martial mastery common to all fighters with a careful study of magic.

**Spellcasting (3rd Level)**

When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells.

**Spells Known:** You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration and evocation schools.

**Spellcasting Ability:** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. 

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Weapon Bond (3rd Level)**

At 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond.

Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can't be disarmed of that weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.

You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can summon only one at a time with your bonus action. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two.

**Eldritch Strike (10th Level)**

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.

### **THIEVES' CANT**

During your rogue training you learned thieves' cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves' cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.

In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.

### **CUNNING ACTION (2ND LEVEL)**

Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

### **EVASION (7TH LEVEL)**

Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an *ice storm* spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### **RELIABLE TALENT (11TH LEVEL)**

By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

### **BLINDSENSE (14TH LEVEL)**

Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.

By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.

### **ELUSIVE (18TH LEVEL)**

Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated.

### **STROKE OF LUCK (20TH LEVEL)**

At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### **ROGUISH ARCHETYPES**

#### **THIEF**

You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype.

**Fast Hands (3rd Level)**

Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves' tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.

**Second-Story Work (3rd Level)**

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.

When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat.

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the disguise kit and the poisoner's kit.

**Assassinate (3rd Level)**

Starting at 3rd level, you are at your deadliest when you get the drop on your enemies. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in the combat yet. In addition, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.

**Infiltration Expertise (9th Level)**

Starting at 9th level, you can unfailingly create false identities for yourself. You must spend seven days and 25 gp to establish the history, profession, and affiliations for an identity. You can't establish an identity that belongs to someone else. Thereafter, if you adopt the new identity as a disguise, other creatures believe you to be that person until given an obvious reason not to.

**Impostor (13th Level)**

At 13th level, you gain the ability to unerringly mimic another person's speech, writing, and behavior. You must spend at least three hours studying these three components of the person's behavior, listening to speech, examining handwriting, and observing mannerisms.

Your ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. If a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Charisma (Deception) check you make to avoid detection.

**Death Strike (17th Level)**

Starting at 17th level, you become a master of instant death. When you attack and hit a creature that is surprised, it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, double the damage of your attack against the creature.

#### **ARCANE TRICKSTER**

Some rogues enhance their fine-honed skills of stealth and agility with magic, learning tricks of enchantment and illusion.

**Spellcasting (3rd Level)**

When you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast spells.

**Cantrips:** You learn three cantrips: *mage hand* and two other cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn another wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

**Spell Slots:** The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have. To cast one of your wizard spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

**Spells Known:** You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the enchantment and illusion schools.

**Spellcasting Ability:** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Mage Hand Legerdemain (3rd Level)**

Starting at 3rd level, when you cast *mage hand*, you can make the spectral hand invisible, and you can perform the following additional tasks with it:
- You can stow one object the hand is holding in a container worn or carried by another creature.
- You can retrieve an object in a container worn or carried by another creature.
- You can use thieves' tools to pick locks and disarm traps at range.

You can perform one of these tasks without being noticed by a creature if you succeed on a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the creature's Wisdom (Perception) check.

In addition, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to control the hand.

**Magical Ambush (9th Level)**

Starting at 9th level, if you are hidden from a creature when you cast a spell on it, the creature has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against the spell this turn.

**Versatile Trickster (13th Level)**

At 13th level, you gain the ability to distract targets with your *mage hand*. As a bonus action on your turn, you can designate a creature within 5 feet of the spectral hand created by the spell. Doing so gives you advantage on attack rolls against that creature until the end of the turn.

**Spell Thief (17th Level)**

At 17th level, you gain the ability to magically steal the knowledge of how to cast a spell from another spellcaster.

Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets you or includes you in its area of effect, you can use your reaction to force the creature to make a saving throw with its spellcasting ability modifier. The DC equals your spell save DC. On a failed save, you negate the spell's effect against you, and you steal the knowledge of the spell if it is at least 1st level and of a level you can cast (it doesn't need to be a wizard spell). For the next 8 hours, you know the spell and can cast it using your spell slots. The creature can't cast that spell until the 8 hours have passed.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### **SPELLCASTING**

You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music. See chapter 7 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 8 for the bard spell list.

**Cantrips**

You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.

**Spell Slots**

The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell *cure wounds* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast *cure wounds* using either slot.

**Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher**

You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

**Spellcasting Ability**

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Ritual Casting**

You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.

**Spellcasting Focus**

You can use a musical instrument as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.

### **BARDIC INSPIRATION**

You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.

Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.

### **JACK OF ALL TRADES (2ND LEVEL)**

Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.

### **SONG OF REST (2ND LEVEL)**

Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.

The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.

### **BARD COLLEGE (3RD LEVEL)**

At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice, such as the College of Lore. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.

### **EXPERTISE (3RD LEVEL)**

At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.

At 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.

### **ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT (4TH, 8TH, 12TH, 16TH, 19TH LEVEL)**

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### **FONT OF INSPIRATION (5TH LEVEL)**

Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.

### **COUNTERCHARM (6TH LEVEL)**

At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).

### **MAGICAL SECRETS (10TH, 14TH, 18TH LEVEL)**

By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells from any class, including this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip.

The chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in the number in the Spells Known column of the Bard table.

You learn two additional spells from any class at 14th level and again at 18th level.

### **SUPERIOR INSPIRATION (20TH LEVEL)**

At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.

### **COLLEGE OF LORE**

Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound.

**Bonus Proficiencies (3rd Level)**

When you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.

**Cutting Words (3rd Level)**

Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature's roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can't hear you or if it's immune to being charmed.

**Additional Magical Secrets (6th Level)**

At 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any class. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you but don't count against the number of bard spells you know.

**Peerless Skill (14th Level)**

Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the DM tells you whether you succeed or fail.

### **SPELLCASTING**

As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. See chapter 7 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 8 for the cleric spell list.

**Cantrips**

At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.

**Preparing and Casting Spells**

The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *cure wounds*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

**Spellcasting Ability**

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Ritual Casting**

You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

**Spellcasting Focus**

You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.

### **DIVINE DOMAIN**

Choose one domain related to your deity: Life domain (detailed below) or others. Each domain provides examples of the gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.

**Domain Spells**

Each domain has a list of spells—its domain spells—that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.

### **CHANNEL DIVINITY (2ND LEVEL)**

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.

Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

**Channel Divinity: Turn Undead**

As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

### **ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT (4TH, 8TH, 12TH, 16TH, 19TH LEVEL)**

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### **DESTROY UNDEAD (5TH LEVEL)**

Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.

**Destroy Undead Table**

| Cleric Level | Destroys Undead of CR... |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| 5th | 1/2 or lower |
| 8th | 1 or lower |
| 11th | 2 or lower |
| 14th | 3 or lower |
| 17th | 4 or lower |

### **DIVINE INTERVENTION (10TH LEVEL)**

Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.

Imploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.

If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.

At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.

### **LIFE DOMAIN**

The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy—one of the fundamental forces of the universe—that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath.

**Life Domain Spells**

| Cleric Level | Spells |
|--------------|--------|
| 1st | *bless*, *cure wounds* |
| 3rd | *lesser restoration*, *spiritual weapon* |
| 5th | *beacon of hope*, *revivify* |
| 7th | *death ward*, *guardian of faith* |
| 9th | *mass cure wounds*, *raise dead* |

**Bonus Proficiency (1st Level)**

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.

**Disciple of Life (1st Level)**

Also starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level.

**Channel Divinity: Preserve Life (2nd Level)**

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal the badly injured.

As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can't use this feature on an undead or a construct.

**Blessed Healer (6th Level)**

Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level.

**Divine Strike (8th Level)**

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

**Supreme Healing (17th Level)**

Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.

### **CLERICS IN TIRVANDOR**

### **DRUIDIC**

You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can't decipher it without magic.

### **SPELLCASTING**

Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See chapter 7 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 8 for the druid spell list.

**Cantrips**

At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.

**Preparing and Casting Spells**

The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *cure wounds*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

**Spellcasting Ability**

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Ritual Casting**

You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

**Spellcasting Focus**

You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.

### **WILD SHAPE (2ND LEVEL)**

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed.

**Beast Shapes Table**

| Level | Max CR | Limitations | Example |
|-------|--------|-------------|---------|
| 2nd | 1/4 | No flying or swimming speed | Wolf |
| 4th | 1/2 | No flying speed | Crocodile |
| 8th | 1 | — | Giant eagle |

You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

- Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.
- When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.
- You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as *call lightning*, that you've already cast.
- You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.
- You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.

### **DRUID CIRCLE (2ND LEVEL)**

At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids, such as the Circle of the Land. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

### **ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT (4TH, 8TH, 12TH, 16TH, 19TH LEVEL)**

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### **TIMELESS BODY (18TH LEVEL)**

Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.

### **BEAST SPELLS (18TH LEVEL)**

Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren't able to provide material components.

### **ARCHDRUID (20TH LEVEL)**

At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.

Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren't consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.

### **CIRCLE OF THE LAND**

The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic.

**Bonus Cantrip (2nd Level)**

When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice.

**Natural Recovery (2nd Level)**

Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.

**Circle Spells (3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th Level)**

Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land—arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp—and consult the associated list of spells.

Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

**Arctic**

|-------------|---------------|
| 3rd | *hold person*, *spike growth* |

| 9th | *insect plague*, *scrying* |

**Land's Stride (6th Level)**

Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such as those created by the *entangle* spell.

**Nature's Ward (10th Level)**

When you reach 10th level, you can't be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.

**Nature's Sanctuary (14th Level)**

When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.

### **UNARMORED DEFENSE**

Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.

### **MARTIAL ARTS**

At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don't have the two-handed or heavy property.

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield:

- You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.
- You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.
- When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.

### **KI (2ND LEVEL)**

Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.

You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.

When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.

Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Ki save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Flurry of Blows**

Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.

**Patient Defense**

You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.

**Step of the Wind**

You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.

### **UNARMORED MOVEMENT (2ND LEVEL)**

Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.

At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.

### **MONASTIC TRADITION (3RD LEVEL)**

When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition, such as the Way of the Open Hand. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.

### **DEFLECT MISSILES (3RD LEVEL)**

Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

### **ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT (4TH, 8TH, 12TH, 16TH, 19TH LEVEL)**

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### **SLOW FALL (4TH LEVEL)**

Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.

### **EXTRA ATTACK (5TH LEVEL)**

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### **STUNNING STRIKE (5TH LEVEL)**

Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent's body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.

### **KI-EMPOWERED STRIKES (6TH LEVEL)**

Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

### **EVASION (7TH LEVEL)**

At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning breath or a *fireball* spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### **STILLNESS OF MIND (7TH LEVEL)**

Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.

### **PURITY OF BODY (10TH LEVEL)**

At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.

### **TONGUE OF THE SUN AND MOON (13TH LEVEL)**

Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.

### **DIAMOND SOUL (14TH LEVEL)**

Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.

Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.

### **TIMELESS BODY (15TH LEVEL)**

At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.

### **EMPTY BODY (18TH LEVEL)**

Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.

Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the *astral projection* spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can't take any other creatures with you.

### **PERFECT SELF (20TH LEVEL)**

At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.

### **WAY OF THE OPEN HAND**

Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm.

**Open Hand Technique (3rd Level)**

Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can manipulate your enemy's ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:

- It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
- It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you.
- It can't take reactions until the end of your next turn.

**Wholeness of Body (6th Level)**

At 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action, you can regain hit points equal to three times your monk level. You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.

**Tranquility (11th Level)**

Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a *sanctuary* spell that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the spell can end early as normal). The saving throw DC for the spell equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus.

**Quivering Palm (17th Level)**

At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone's body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 necrotic damage.

You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an action.

### **DIVINE SENSE**

The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the *hallow* spell.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

### **LAY ON HANDS**

Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level × 5.

As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.

Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.

This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.

### **FIGHTING STYLE (2ND LEVEL)**

At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

**Defense:** While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

**Dueling:** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

**Great Weapon Fighting:** When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

**Protection:** When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.

### **SPELLCASTING (2ND LEVEL)**

By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See chapter 7 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 8 for the paladin spell list.

**Preparing and Casting Spells**

The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *cure wounds*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

**Spellcasting Ability**

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Spellcasting Focus**

You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.

### **DIVINE SMITE (2ND LEVEL)**

Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.

### **DIVINE HEALTH (3RD LEVEL)**

By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.

### **SACRED OATH (3RD LEVEL)**

When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion or another oath (detailed at the end of the class description).

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.

**Oath Spells**

Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

If you gain an oath spell that doesn't appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.

**Channel Divinity**

Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.

### **ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT (4TH, 8TH, 12TH, 16TH, 19TH LEVEL)**

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### **EXTRA ATTACK (5TH LEVEL)**

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### **AURA OF PROTECTION (6TH LEVEL)**

Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

### **AURA OF COURAGE (10TH LEVEL)**

Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be frightened while you are conscious.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

### **IMPROVED DIVINE SMITE (11TH LEVEL)**

By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.

### **CLEANSING TOUCH (14TH LEVEL)**

Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### **OATH OF DEVOTION**

The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards.

**Tenets of Devotion**

Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.

**Honesty.** Don't lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.

**Courage.** Never fear to act, though caution is wise.

**Compassion.** Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.

**Honor.** Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm.

**Duty.** Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you.

**Oath Spells**

You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

| Paladin Level | Spells |
|---------------|--------|
| 3rd | *protection from evil and good*, *sanctuary* |
| 5th | *lesser restoration*, *zone of truth* |
| 9th | *beacon of hope*, *dispel magic* |
| 13th | *freedom of movement*, *guardian of faith* |
| 17th | *commune*, *flame strike* |

**Channel Divinity (3rd Level)**

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

**Sacred Weapon.** As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.

You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.

**Turn the Unholy.** As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

**Aura of Devotion (7th Level)**

Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be charmed while you are conscious.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

**Purity of Spirit (15th Level)**

Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a *protection from evil and good* spell.

**Holy Nimbus (20th Level)**

At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that.

Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage.

In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### **PALADINS IN TIRVANDOR**

**Origin:** Sacred oaths, knightly orders, divine calling

**Oaths & The Ascended:**

Paladins in Tirvandor swear oaths inspired by (but not directly to) the Ascended:

- **Oath of Devotion** → Inspired by Aethor the Liberator or Sera the Healer
- **Oath of the Ancients** → Inspired by Sylvara the Wild
- **Oath of Vengeance** → Inspired by Mordain the Sentinel
- **Oath of Conquest** → Inspired by Thandros the Lawbringer

**Cultural Context:**
- Holy warriors bound by sacred oaths
- Respected as champions of causes
- Divine power comes from strength of conviction (not gods directly)
- Knights, crusaders, and champions
- Code of conduct essential to powers

**In Tirvandor:**
- **Thaldros:** Royal Paladins (Order enforcers, Conquest oaths common)
- **Aethoria:** Freedom Paladins (Justice champions, Devotion and Ancients common)
- **Border:** Rare but respected (oath-bound mercenaries, any oath)

**In Campaigns:**
- **Blood & Coin:** Challenging but very rewarding (oath vs grey reality creates drama)
- **Shattered Oaths:** Excellent (classic holy warrior, oath tested by darkness)

### **FAVORED ENEMY**

Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.

Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.

You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.

When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.

You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.

### **NATURAL EXPLORER**

You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you're proficient in.

While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:

- Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel.
- Your group can't become lost except by magical means.
- Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
- If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
- When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.
- While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.

You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.

### **FIGHTING STYLE (2ND LEVEL)**

At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

**Archery:** You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

**Defense:** While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

**Dueling:** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

**Two-Weapon Fighting:** When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

### **SPELLCASTING (2ND LEVEL)**

By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 7 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 8 for the ranger spell list.

**Spell Slots**

The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell *animal friendship* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast *animal friendship* using either slot.

**Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher**

You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

**Spellcasting Ability**

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

### **RANGER ARCHETYPE (3RD LEVEL)**

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: Hunter. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.

### **PRIMEVAL AWARENESS (3RD LEVEL)**

Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn't reveal the creatures' location or number.

### **ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT (4TH, 8TH, 12TH, 16TH, 19TH LEVEL)**

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### **EXTRA ATTACK (5TH LEVEL)**

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### **LAND'S STRIDE (8TH LEVEL)**

Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such as those created by the *entangle* spell.

### **HIDE IN PLAIN SIGHT (10TH LEVEL)**

Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.

Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.

### **VANISH (14TH LEVEL)**

Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.

### **FERAL SENSES (18TH LEVEL)**

At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.

You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened.

### **FOE SLAYER (20TH LEVEL)**

At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.

### **HUNTER**

Emulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your place as a bulwark between civilization and the terrors of the wilderness. As you walk the Hunter's path, you learn specialized techniques for fighting the threats you face, from rampaging ogres and hordes of orcs to towering giants and terrifying dragons.

**Hunter's Prey (3rd Level)**

At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

**Colossus Slayer.** Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage if it's below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.

**Giant Killer.** When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature.

**Horde Breaker.** Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon.

**Defensive Tactics (7th Level)**

At 7th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

**Escape the Horde.** Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.

**Multiattack Defense.** When a creature hits you with an attack, you gain a +4 bonus to AC against all subsequent attacks made by that creature for the rest of the turn.

**Steel Will.** You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.

**Multiattack (11th Level)**

At 11th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

**Volley.** You can use your action to make a ranged attack against any number of creatures within 10 feet of a point you can see within your weapon's range. You must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and you make a separate attack roll for each target.

**Whirlwind Attack.** You can use your action to make a melee attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target.

**Superior Hunter's Defense (15th Level)**

At 15th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

**Evasion.** When you are subjected to an effect, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or a *lightning bolt* spell, that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

**Stand Against the Tide.** When a hostile creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to repeat the same attack against another creature (other than itself) of your choice.

**Uncanny Dodge.** When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.

### **RANGERS IN TIRVANDOR**

### **SPELLCASTING**

An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells. See chapter 7 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 8 for the sorcerer spell list.

**Cantrips**

At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table.

**Spell Slots**

The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

**Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher**

You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

**Spellcasting Ability**

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Spellcasting Focus**

You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.

### **SORCEROUS ORIGIN**

Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate magical power, such as Draconic Bloodline.

Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.

### **FONT OF MAGIC (2ND LEVEL)**

At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.

**Sorcery Points**

You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer table. You can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.

**Flexible Casting**

You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points.

**Creating Spell Slots:** You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level. You can create spell slots no higher than 5th level.

Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a long rest.

**Creating Spell Slots Table**

| Spell Slot Level | Sorcery Point Cost |
|------------------|-------------------|
| 1st | 2 |
| 2nd | 3 |
| 3rd | 5 |
| 4th | 6 |
| 5th | 7 |

**Converting a Spell Slot to Sorcery Points:** As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of sorcery points equal to the slot's level.

### **METAMAGIC (3RD LEVEL)**

At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level.

You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.

**Careful Spell**

When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.

**Distant Spell**

When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell.

When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the spell 30 feet.

**Empowered Spell**

When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.

You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

**Extended Spell**

When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

**Heightened Spell**

When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.

**Quickened Spell**

When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.

**Subtle Spell**

When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.

**Twinned Spell**

When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).

To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell's current level. For example, *magic missile* and *scorching ray* aren't eligible, but *ray of frost* and *chromatic orb* are.

### **ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT (4TH, 8TH, 12TH, 16TH, 19TH LEVEL)**

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### **SORCEROUS RESTORATION (20TH LEVEL)**

At 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish a short rest.

### **DRACONIC BLOODLINE**

Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.

**Dragon Ancestor (1st Level)**

At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later.

| Dragon | Damage Type |
|--------|-------------|
| Black | Acid |
| Blue | Lightning |
| Brass | Fire |
| Bronze | Lightning |
| Copper | Acid |
| Gold | Fire |
| Green | Poison |
| Red | Fire |
| Silver | Cold |
| White | Cold |

You can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.

**Draconic Resilience (1st Level)**

As magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.

Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.

**Elemental Affinity (6th Level)**

Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell. At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.

**Dragon Wings (14th Level)**

At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.

You can't manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.

**Draconic Presence (18th Level)**

Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours.

### **SORCERERS IN TIRVANDOR**

**Origin:** Born with magic, magical accidents, bloodlines

**Sorcerous Origins in Tirvandor:**

- **Draconic Bloodline:** Ancient dragons once ruled parts of Tirvandor - some bloodlines remain
- **Wild Magic:** Magical experiments gone wrong, exposure to raw magic
- **Divine Soul:** Touched by one of the Seven Ascended (rare blessing or curse)
- **Shadow Magic:** Exposure to dark magic or shadow realms

**Cultural Context:**
- Born with innate magic (not learned like wizards)
- Less common than wizards
- Innate power viewed as rare gift or dangerous curse
- Can be unstable and unpredictable
- Some fear sorcerers, others revere them

**In Tirvandor:**
- **Thaldros:** Must register with authorities, closely monitored (fear of uncontrolled power)
- **Aethoria:** Free to practice, celebrated as natural talent
- **Border:** Unregulated, valuable for raw magical power

**In Campaigns:**
- **Blood & Coin:** Excellent (raw magical power, flexible spellcasting, dramatic)
- **Shattered Oaths:** Excellent (chosen one potential, destiny themes)

### **OTHERWORLDLY PATRON**

### **PACT MAGIC**

Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells. See chapter 7 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 8 for the warlock spell list.

You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.

**Spell Slots**

The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

**Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher**

At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.

### **PACT BOON (3RD LEVEL)**

At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service.

**Pact of the Chain**

You learn *find familiar* and can cast it as a ritual. You can choose imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite as familiar forms. When you take the Attack action, you can forgo one attack to let your familiar attack with its reaction.

**Pact of the Blade**

You can create a pact weapon in your empty hand as an action. You choose its form each time. You're proficient with it. It counts as magical. It disappears if more than 5 feet away for 1 minute, if you use this feature again, or if you dismiss it.

**Pact of the Tome**

Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. Choose three cantrips from any class's spell list. While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They're warlock cantrips for you. If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement.

### **ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT (4TH, 8TH, 12TH, 16TH, 19TH LEVEL)**

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score by 2, or two ability scores by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### **MYSTIC ARCANUM (11TH LEVEL)**

At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum.

You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.

### **ELDRITCH MASTER (20TH LEVEL)**

At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

### **THE FIEND PATRON**

You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of existence, a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims. Such beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you.

**Expanded Spell List**

The Fiend lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

| Spell Level | Spells |
|-------------|--------|
| 1st | *burning hands*, *command* |
| 2nd | *blindness/deafness*, *scorching ray* |
| 3rd | *fireball*, *stinking cloud* |
| 4th | *fire shield*, *wall of fire* |
| 5th | *flame strike*, *hallow* |

**Dark One's Blessing (1st Level)**

Starting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your warlock level (minimum of 1).

**Dark One's Own Luck (6th Level)**

Starting at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll's effects occur.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

**Fiendish Resilience (10th Level)**

Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance.

**Hurl Through Hell (14th Level)**

Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.

At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### **WARLOCKS IN TIRVANDOR**

**Origin:** Pacts with otherworldly entities, forbidden bargains

**Otherworldly Patrons in Tirvandor:**

All patron types exist but are controversial:

- **The Fiend:** Infernal pacts with devils or demons (heavily distrusted and feared)
- **The Great Old One:** Pacts with incomprehensible entities beyond reality
- **The Archfey:** Pacts with powerful fey lords (less distrusted than fiends)
- **The Celestial:** Pacts with angelic beings (more accepted)

**Cultural Context:**
- Pact magic from otherworldly entities
- "Sold soul for power" reputation
- Controversial and distrusted by most
- Not inherently evil but widely assumed to be
- Power comes at a price (the pact)
- Short rest recovery makes them versatile

**In Tirvandor:**
- **Thaldros:** Actively hunted as heretics and demon-worshippers (illegal)
- **Aethoria:** Tolerated but watched carefully (legal but suspicious)
- **Border:** Must keep pact secret, valued for power if discreet

**In Campaigns:**
- **Blood & Coin:** Excellent (morally grey power, flexible, pact creates drama)
- **Shattered Oaths:** Good (requires explanation of pact, oath vs pact tension)

---

### **SPELLCASTING**

As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See chapter 7 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 8 for the wizard spell list.

**Cantrips**

At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.

**Spellbook**

At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.

**Preparing and Casting Spells**

The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *magic missile*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

**Spellcasting Ability**

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Ritual Casting**

You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.

**Spellcasting Focus**

You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

**Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher**

Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see "Your Spellbook" sidebar).

**Your Spellbook**

The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.

**Copying a Spell into the Book.** When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.

Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.

For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.

**Replacing the Book.** You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.

If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.

**The Book's Appearance.** Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.

### **ARCANE RECOVERY (1ST LEVEL)**

You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.

For example, if you're a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.

### **ARCANE TRADITION (2ND LEVEL)**

When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools, such as Evocation.

Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

### **ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT (4TH, 8TH, 12TH, 16TH, 19TH LEVEL)**

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### **SPELL MASTERY (18TH LEVEL)**

At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.

### **SIGNATURE SPELLS (20TH LEVEL)**

When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don't count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

### **SCHOOL OF EVOCATION**

You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.

**Evocation Savant (2nd Level)**

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.

**Sculpt Spells (2nd Level)**

Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell's level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.

**Potent Cantrip (6th Level)**

Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip's damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.

**Empowered Evocation (10th Level)**

Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast.

**Overchannel (14th Level)**

Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.

The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.

# CHAPTER 6: CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS
}}


## MULTICLASSING

Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.

### PREREQUISITES

To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one.

| Class | Ability Score Minimum |
|-------|-----------------------|
| Barbarian | Strength 13 |
| Bard | Charisma 13 |
| Cleric | Wisdom 13 |
| Druid | Wisdom 13 |
| Fighter | Strength 13 or Dexterity 13 |
| Monk | Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13 |
| Paladin | Strength 13 and Charisma 13 |
| Ranger | Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13 |
| Rogue | Dexterity 13 |
| Sorcerer | Charisma 13 |
| Warlock | Charisma 13 |
| Wizard | Intelligence 13 |

### EXPERIENCE POINTS

The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class.

### HIT POINTS AND HIT DICE

You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.

### PROFICIENCY BONUS

Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class.

### PROFICIENCIES

When you gain a level in a class other than your first, you gain only some of that class's starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table in the D&D 5e rules.

### CLASS FEATURES

You get all the class features of all your classes, but you must meet level requirements individually for each class.

### SPELLCASTING

Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. (Refer to D&D 5e rules for multiclass spellcasting details)

## FEATS

A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides.

### GAINING FEATS

At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can't take a feat more than once, unless the feat's description says otherwise.

### FEAT PREREQUISITES

Some feats have prerequisites. You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat's prerequisite, you can't use that feat until you regain the prerequisite.

### SAMPLE FEATS

Common feats include (refer to D&D 5e SRD for full details):

- **Alert:** +5 initiative, can't be surprised
- **Athlete:** Improved climbing, jumping, standing
- **Grappler:** Advantage on grapple attacks
- **Lucky:** 3 luck points per long rest

## PATH OF THE BORDER REAVER (Barbarian)
}}


*Mercenary raiders from the lawless Border regions who have mastered brutal, adaptable combat*

The Border is a harsh place where only the strong survive. Border Reavers are barbarians who have learned to channel their rage into calculated violence, fighting dirty when needed and adapting to any battlefield. They're professional survivors who turn their fury into a weapon for hire.


#### REAVER'S INSTINCT (3RD LEVEL)

When you choose this path at 3rd level, your survival instincts become supernaturally sharp. You gain the following benefits:

- **Always Ready:** You gain a bonus to initiative rolls equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum +1). You can't be surprised while you are conscious.

- **Scavenger:** When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you can use your bonus action to immediately search the body. You find 1d10 gold pieces, one use of a consumable item (DM's choice: potion, ammunition, etc.), or useful battlefield information.

- **Adaptable Combatant:** When you finish a short or long rest, choose one damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. While raging, you have resistance to that damage type. You can change your choice when you finish another short or long rest.


#### DIRTY FIGHTING (6TH LEVEL)

Starting at 6th level, you've learned that honor means nothing in a real fight. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack while raging, you can choose to fight dirty. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or suffer one of the following effects of your choice:

- **Sand in the Eyes:** The target is blinded until the end of your next turn.
- **Low Blow:** The target's speed is reduced to 0 until the end of your next turn.
- **Disarm:** The target drops one item it is holding (your choice).

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.


#### REAVER'S ENDURANCE (10TH LEVEL)

At 10th level, your time surviving in the brutal Border has made you incredibly resilient. You gain the following benefits:

- **Hardened:** When you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, the minimum number you can roll is equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1).

- **Never Stay Down:** When you are reduced to 0 hit points while raging and don't die outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

- **Survivor's Stamina:** You can add your Constitution modifier to death saving throws.


#### CALCULATED FURY (14TH LEVEL)

Beginning at 14th level, you've learned to channel your rage with deadly precision. While raging, you gain the following benefits:

- **Exploit Weakness:** Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you deal an extra 1d6 damage if you have advantage on the attack roll or if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it.

- **Battle Awareness:** You can take the Dodge action as a bonus action.

- **Professional's Instinct:** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and initiative rolls.


#### TIRVANDOR CONTEXT

**Origin:** Border regions between Thaldros and Aethoria

**Culture:** These barbarians are professional survivors and mercenaries. They're respected in the Border towns for their effectiveness but feared for their brutality. Many are Iron Guild members.

**In Campaigns:**
- **Blood & Coin:** PERFECT - quintessential mercenary barbarian
- **Shattered Oaths:** Good - former reaver turned hero or antagonist

## PATH OF REVOLUTIONARY FURY (Barbarian)
}}


*Aethorian freedom fighters who channel righteous rage against oppression and tyranny*

Some barbarians don't rage from bloodlust or primal fury—they rage from injustice. Revolutionary Fury barbarians are freedom fighters whose anger at tyranny and oppression fuels superhuman strength. They break chains, shatter walls, and inspire hope in the oppressed with their unstoppable wrath.


#### FURY OF THE OPPRESSED (3RD LEVEL)

When you choose this path at 3rd level, your rage becomes a weapon against tyranny. You gain the following benefits:

- **Breaker of Chains:** While raging, you have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws to break objects, escape restraints, or force open doors and barriers. You deal double damage to objects and structures.

- **Tyrant's Bane:** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened. While raging, you are immune to being charmed or frightened.

- **Righteous Fury:** When you enter your rage, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet. Until your rage ends, you deal an extra 1d6 damage to that creature whenever you hit it with a weapon attack. This extra damage increases to 2d6 at 10th level and 3d6 at 14th level. The target should be one you perceive as an oppressor, authority figure, or enemy of freedom (DM's discretion).


#### INSPIRE RESISTANCE (6TH LEVEL)

Starting at 6th level, your fury inspires others to resist. When you rage, you can choose a number of allies equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) within 30 feet of you who can see or hear you. Each chosen ally gains temporary hit points equal to your barbarian level and has advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed for the duration of your rage.

Once a creature gains temporary hit points from this feature, it can't gain them again until it finishes a short or long rest.


#### UNBREAKABLE WILL (10TH LEVEL)

At 10th level, your commitment to freedom makes your spirit unbreakable. You gain the following benefits:

- **Freedom's Resilience:** While raging, you have resistance to psychic damage, and you are immune to any effect that would reduce your speed or restrain you.

- **Liberator:** You can use an action to attempt to free a willing creature within 5 feet of you from restraints, grapples, or magical effects that restrain or paralyze. Make a Strength check with a DC determined by the DM (typically DC 15 for mundane restraints, DC 20 for magical effects). On a success, the target is freed. While raging, you have advantage on this check.


#### REVOLUTION'S CHAMPION (14TH LEVEL)

Beginning at 14th level, you become an avatar of revolutionary fury. You gain the following benefits:

- **Unyielding Rage:** While raging, you can't be knocked prone or moved against your will.

- **Shatter Oppression:** When you rage, you can choose to release a shockwave of revolutionary fury. Each creature of your choice within 10 feet of you must make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone. Structures and objects within this area take 4d6 force damage.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

- **Voice of Freedom:** You can use your action to rally allies. Each friendly creature within 30 feet of you that can hear you gains advantage on their next attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.


#### TIRVANDOR CONTEXT

**Origin:** Aethoria (primarily), or former Thaldros slaves

**Culture:** Revolutionary Fury barbarians are heroes to the oppressed and terrorists to authorities. In Aethoria, they're celebrated freedom fighters. In Thaldros, they're hunted as dangerous rebels. Many have personal histories of slavery, imprisonment, or witnessing tyranny.

**Philosophical Note:** These barbarians believe freedom is worth any price. Their rage isn't mindless—it's the righteous anger of those who refuse to live in chains.

**In Campaigns:**
- **Blood & Coin:** Good - revolutionary turned mercenary, or hired to fight oppressors
- **Shattered Oaths:** EXCELLENT - perfect heroic revolutionary archetype

---

## DESIGN NOTES

**Balance Considerations:**

**Border Reaver:**
- Comparable to Berserker/Totem Warrior in power
- Scavenger feature is utility/flavor, not combat power
- Dirty Fighting is limited use but strong control
- Never Stay Down comparable to Relentless Rage (but different trigger)

**Revolutionary Fury:**
- Breaker of Chains is utility focused
- Righteous Fury comparable to Zealot's Divine Fury
- Inspire Resistance is support-focused (barbarian rarely does this)
- Shatter Oppression once per long rest keeps it balanced

**Flavor vs Mechanics:**
- Border Reaver: Practical, adaptable, professional
- Revolutionary Fury: Inspiring, freedom-focused, heroic

Both feel distinct from each other and from official barbarian paths!

**Next: Bard Colleges (College of Propaganda & College of the Iron Tongue)**

## COLLEGE OF PROPAGANDA (Bard)
}}


*Masters of information warfare who wield words as weapons to shape public opinion and control narratives*

Whether serving a state or a revolution, bards of the College of Propaganda understand that controlling information is as powerful as any spell. They are masters of spin, manipulation, and mass persuasion, capable of turning friend to foe and hero to villain with carefully chosen words.


#### BONUS PROFICIENCIES (3RD LEVEL)

When you join the College of Propaganda at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in Deception and Persuasion. If you are already proficient in either skill, you gain proficiency in another skill of your choice from the bard skill list.

You also learn Thieves' Cant, the secret language used to embed hidden messages in seemingly innocent conversation.


#### SPIN DOCTOR (3RD LEVEL)

Also at 3rd level, you learn to reshape narratives and manipulate perception. You gain the following abilities:

- **Twist the Truth:** When you make a Charisma (Deception) or Charisma (Persuasion) check, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration to add the Bardic Inspiration die to your roll. You can wait until after you roll the d20 to decide.

- **Countermessaging:** When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes a Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Deception) check, you can use your reaction to expend one use of Bardic Inspiration and subtract the Bardic Inspiration die from their roll. You can wait until after they roll to decide.

- **Plant the Seed:** When you successfully deceive or persuade a creature, you can implant a false belief in their mind. The creature believes your lie or accepts your argument as unquestionable truth for 1 hour. If presented with obvious evidence contradicting the belief, they may question it (DM's discretion). Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.


#### PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN (6TH LEVEL)

Starting at 6th level, you can launch coordinated information campaigns. Over the course of 1 hour (which can be during a rest), you can spread rumors, plant false information, or shape public opinion about a specific person, organization, or event.

Choose one of the following effects:

- **Smear Campaign:** Choose a creature known to the local population. For the next 24 hours, creatures in the settlement have disadvantage on Charisma checks made to aid or support that creature, and the target has disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks in the settlement.

- **Heroic Narrative:** Choose a creature known to the local population. For the next 24 hours, that creature has advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks in the settlement, and NPCs are predisposed to trust them.

- **Disinformation:** You spread a false but believable story. The DM determines the effects, but typically NPCs in the settlement believe the story unless presented with strong evidence to the contrary.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. The effects end early if you are revealed as the source of the propaganda.


#### INFECTIOUS RHETORIC (14TH LEVEL)

At 14th level, your words can spread like wildfire through a population. You gain the following abilities:

- **Mass Manipulation:** When you cast a spell that charms a creature, you can target one additional creature within range for each level of the spell slot used (minimum of 1 additional target).

- **Fanatical Loyalty:** When a creature is charmed by you, it becomes fanatically loyal to you and your cause. It will defend your reputation, spread your message, and actively work to further your goals to the best of its ability. When the charm ends, the creature doesn't immediately realize it was magically influenced unless it acts completely contrary to its normal behavior.

- **Control the Narrative:** You can cast *modify memory* once without expending a spell slot. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.


#### TIRVANDOR CONTEXT

**Origin:** Can serve either Thaldros (state propaganda) or Aethoria (revolutionary messaging)

**Culture:** 

**In Thaldros:** Propaganda bards are state-sponsored agents who control official narratives, suppress dissent, and shape public opinion in favor of the crown. They're well-paid but closely watched.

**In Aethoria:** Propaganda bards are revolutionary orators who spread messages of freedom, counter Thaldros propaganda, and inspire resistance. They're celebrated as heroes of the people.

**In the Border:** Some propaganda bards work as freelance spin doctors, selling their services to whoever pays.

**Moral Ambiguity:** This college is morally neutral—it's a tool that can be used for good (inspiring freedom) or evil (justifying tyranny). The bard's alignment matters more than the college itself.

**In Campaigns:**
- **Blood & Coin:** EXCELLENT - hired to manage a client's reputation or spread disinformation
- **Shattered Oaths:** Good - revolutionary propagandist or antagonist state agent

## COLLEGE OF THE IRON TONGUE (Bard)
}}


*Border diplomats and contract specialists who broker deals and enforce agreements with magic*

The Iron Tongue bards are mercenary mediators affiliated with the Iron Guild. They are masters of negotiation, contract law, and deal-making who use magic to ensure agreements are honored. In the cutthroat world of Border mercenary work, their services are invaluable.


#### BONUS PROFICIENCIES (3RD LEVEL)

When you join the College of the Iron Tongue at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in Insight and Persuasion. If you are already proficient in either skill, you gain proficiency in another skill of your choice from the bard skill list.

You also gain proficiency with calligrapher's supplies and learn to read and write legal contracts in multiple languages.


#### SILVER TONGUE (3RD LEVEL)

Also at 3rd level, you become a master negotiator. You gain the following abilities:

- **Read the Room:** You can use a bonus action to make a Wisdom (Insight) check against a creature you can see. On a success, you learn the creature's current emotional state and whether it is lying. You also learn what it wants most in the current situation (gold, safety, revenge, etc.).

- **Compelling Offer:** When you make a Charisma (Persuasion) check to negotiate, broker a deal, or convince someone to accept terms, you can add your Bardic Inspiration die to the roll without expending a use of Bardic Inspiration. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

- **Detect Deception:** You have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks made to determine if someone is lying during a negotiation.


#### BINDING CONTRACT (6TH LEVEL)

Starting at 6th level, you can create magically enforced contracts. When two or more willing creatures agree to terms you've negotiated, you can use an action to create a binding magical contract. The contract must be written down, and all parties must sign it (or make their mark).

The contract has the following properties:

- **Magical Enforcement:** All parties know immediately if another party breaks the terms of the contract. You are always aware when any term is violated, no matter the distance.

- **Compulsion:** When a party attempts to directly violate a major term of the contract, they must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = your spell save DC) or be unable to complete the action. This doesn't prevent indirect violations or creative interpretation.

- **Duration:** The contract lasts until its terms are fulfilled, all parties agree to void it, or you end it as an action. You can maintain a number of contracts equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).

- **Witness Protection:** You can sense the general direction and condition (alive, dead, healthy, wounded) of all creatures bound by your contracts within 1 mile of you.


#### IRON GUILD CONNECTIONS (6TH LEVEL)

Also at 6th level, your affiliation with the Iron Guild grants you special privileges:

- You can identify other Iron Guild members on sight.
- You have advantage on Charisma checks when dealing with Iron Guild members.
- You can access Iron Guild safe houses, which provide free lodging and information about local mercenary work.
- You gain a +2 bonus to your Iron Guild reputation score (if using the reputation system from Blood & Coin campaign).


#### MASTER MEDIATOR (14TH LEVEL)

At 14th level, you become legendary in the world of negotiation and deal-making. You gain the following abilities:

- **Legendary Negotiator:** When you roll initiative and aren't surprised, you can use your reaction to attempt to negotiate instead of fighting. Make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by the Wisdom (Insight) check of one creature that can hear and understand you. On a success, that creature and its allies will hear you out for 1 minute before combat begins. During this time, you can attempt to negotiate a peaceful resolution, bribe them, or convince them to leave.

- **Unbreakable Terms:** Contracts you create with Binding Contract become much more powerful:
  - Creatures that violate major terms take 4d10 psychic damage and suffer one level of exhaustion.
  - Creatures that violate minor terms take 2d10 psychic damage.
  - You can include a clause that teleports a creature to a designated location if they violate terms (the creature gets a Wisdom save to resist).

- **Arbitrator's Authority:** You can cast *geas* once without expending a spell slot, but only as part of a negotiated agreement where all parties consent. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.


#### NEW SPELL: IRON WORD
*3rd-level enchantment*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a signed contract)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You speak a binding word of enforcement. Choose one creature within range that you have a contract with. That creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to honor the terms of your agreement. While affected, the creature has disadvantage on any action that would violate the contract and automatically fails Charisma (Deception) checks related to the contract terms.

**Bards of the College of the Iron Tongue learn this spell automatically at 3rd level, and it doesn't count against their spells known.**


#### TIRVANDOR CONTEXT

**Origin:** Border regions, affiliated with the Iron Guild

**Culture:** Iron Tongue bards are respected neutral parties in the mercenary world. They broker contracts between mercenaries and clients, mediate disputes between rival companies, and ensure deals are honored. Their magical enforcement makes them invaluable—and wealthy.

**Reputation:** In the Border, an Iron Tongue bard's word is gold. They're trusted because breaking their contracts has severe magical consequences. Both Thaldros and Aethoria hire them for diplomatic missions when they need a guaranteed neutral party.

**Philosophy:** "Every person has a price, and every problem has a solution—if the terms are right."

**In Campaigns:**
- **Blood & Coin:** PERFECT - THE mercenary support class, contract specialist
- **Shattered Oaths:** Challenging but possible - neutral mediator in a world at war

---

## DESIGN NOTES

**Balance Considerations:**

**College of Propaganda:**
- Spin Doctor is powerful for social encounters but situational
- Propaganda Campaign is once per long rest and requires time
- Infectious Rhetoric is very strong but limited to charm spells
- Comparable power to College of Eloquence but with manipulation focus

**College of the Iron Tongue:**
- Silver Tongue is utility-focused, good for skill checks
- Binding Contract is powerful but requires willing participants
- Unbreakable Terms damage is comparable to other 14th level features
- Iron Word is a new spell but limited in scope

**Flavor vs Mechanics:**
- Propaganda: Mass manipulation, narrative control, psychological warfare
- Iron Tongue: Contracts, negotiation, magical enforcement, mercenary culture

Both provide strong social/utility options while remaining balanced for combat!

## TIRVANDOR CONTEXT

Each of the Seven has their champions, and they're often called upon when martial might and divine magic are both needed.

**In Campaigns:**
- **Blood & Coin:** Good - mercenary priest, former chaplain, or hired divine warrior
- **Shattered Oaths:** Excellent - chosen champion for heroic deeds

---

#### CHANNEL DIVINITY: RALLY THE TROOPS (2ND LEVEL)

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to bolster your allies' spirits. As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer of encouragement. Each friendly creature within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you gains temporary hit points equal to your cleric level + your Wisdom modifier and has advantage on their next attack roll or saving throw.


#### CHANNEL DIVINITY: GUARDIAN'S SACRIFICE (6TH LEVEL)

Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to protect your squad at great personal cost. When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to take that damage instead. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way.

**Culture:**

**In Thaldros:** War Chaplains are official military positions, serving in every regiment. They're part of the command structure and report to both religious and military authorities.

**In Aethoria:** War Chaplains serve with militia units and People's Army regiments. They're more informal but no less dedicated, often volunteers from local temples.

**In the Border:** Mercenary companies hire War Chaplains to keep their soldiers alive and morale high. Iron Guild companies often have at least one on retainer.

**Philosophy:** War Chaplains believe that faith and fellowship in battle create unbreakable bonds. They're not pacifists—they understand that sometimes violence is necessary—but they honor the sacrifice of soldiers and try to minimize suffering.

**In Campaigns:**
- **Blood & Coin:** Excellent - mercenary chaplain, hired to keep soldiers alive
- **Shattered Oaths:** Excellent - military chaplain for heroic army

---

## DESIGN NOTES

**Balance Considerations:**

**Ascended Champion Domain:**
- Each variant is balanced against other martial cleric domains (War, Forge, Twilight)
- Divine Strike/Champion's Strike comparable to similar features
- Channel Divinity options are situationally powerful but not game-breaking
- 17th level features are capstones comparable to other domains

**War Chaplain Domain:**
- Strong support/healing focus
- Battlefield Blessing is powerful but limited uses
- Rally the Troops is strong but once per short rest
- Guardian's Sacrifice is risky but thematic
- Unyielding Faith is strong aura but appropriate for 17th level

Both domains provide strong martial + divine options for clerics!

**Next: Druid Circles (Circle of the Contested Lands & Circle of the Ascended Wild)**

## CIRCLE OF THE CONTESTED LANDS (Druid)
}}


*Druids who protect the war-torn wilderness of the Border, adapting to any terrain and battlefield*

The lands between Thaldros and Aethoria have become a scarred, contested wilderness where armies march and nature suffers. Druids of this circle are neutral guardians who protect what remains of the wild, adapting to any terrain and using the very tools of war against those who would destroy nature.


#### CIRCLE SPELLS

Your mystical connection to contested lands grants you access to certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells.

Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

  - **Battle-Scarred:** Gain temporary hit points equal to your druid level

  - **Camouflaged:** Advantage on Stealth checks in natural terrain

- **Wasteland Stride:** Difficult terrain created by debris, rubble, or battlefield conditions doesn't cost you extra movement.


#### WAR-TOUCHED MAGIC (6TH LEVEL)

Starting at 6th level, you can channel the harsh magic of contested lands. You gain the following abilities:

- **Scavenger's Instinct:** You can use your action to touch a weapon or piece of armor that has been on a battlefield. The item becomes magical for 1 hour, gaining a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls (weapon) or AC (armor). You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, regaining expended uses on a long rest.

- **Battlefield Harvest:** When you finish a short or long rest in a contested or war-torn area, you find useful materials. Roll 1d6: 1-2 (nothing), 3-4 (1d4 × 10 gp worth of supplies), 5-6 (one uncommon consumable magic item or component worth up to 100 gp).


#### CONTESTED GROUND (10TH LEVEL)

At 10th level, you can transform an area into treacherous contested terrain. As an action, you cause a 30-foot radius area within 120 feet to become hostile terrain for 10 minutes. Choose one effect:

- **Entangling Debris:** The area becomes difficult terrain. Creatures that enter or start their turn there must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be restrained until the start of their next turn.

- **Hazardous Ground:** The area is filled with caltrops, broken weapons, and hazards. Creatures take 2d6 piercing damage when they enter or start their turn there.

- **Obscuring Smoke:** The area is heavily obscured by dust, smoke, or fog.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.


#### GUARDIAN OF THE BORDER (14TH LEVEL)

At 14th level, you become the ultimate defender of contested lands. You gain the following benefits:

- **Adaptive Wild Shape:** When you use Wild Shape, you can assume the form of beasts with CR up to 2 (instead of 1), and you can choose one additional trait from Scarred Beast Forms.

- **Neutral Ground:** You can cast *plant growth* without expending a spell slot. When you do, the area also becomes a sanctuary—creatures that enter must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to make attack rolls while in the area. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

- **War's End:** When you drop to 0 hit points in Wild Shape form, you can choose to have the beast form explode in a burst of primal fury. Each creature within 10 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d10 force damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. You then revert to your normal form.


#### TIRVANDOR CONTEXT

**Origin:** Border wilderness, contested zones

**Culture:** These druids are lone guardians or part of small circles protecting specific regions. They're fiercely neutral, attacking any army (Thaldros or Aethoria) that threatens their lands. Both nations consider them dangerous obstacles.

**Philosophy:** "Nature endures. Empires fall. We remain."

**In Campaigns:**
- **Blood & Coin:** Good - neutral wilderness guide, hired protector
- **Shattered Oaths:** Good - protector of sacred groves in war zones

## CIRCLE OF THE ASCENDED WILD (Druid)
}}


*Druids who serve Sylvara the Wild, embodying the primal fury and beauty of untamed nature*

While most druids honor nature generally, some dedicate themselves specifically to Sylvara the Wild, the most primal of the Seven Ascended. These druids embody her storm-touched fury and wild beauty, becoming avatars of nature's raw power.


#### CIRCLE SPELLS

Your connection to Sylvara grants you access to certain spells.

| Druid Level | Circle Spells |

  - At 6th level: giant scorpion, rhinoceros  
  - At 10th level: Any beast of CR 2 or lower


#### CHANNEL SYLVARA (2ND LEVEL)

Also at 2nd level, you can channel Sylvara's power. You gain two Channel Divinity options:

- **Wild's Fury:** As an action, you can cause nature to lash out. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 lightning or thunder damage (your choice) and is knocked prone. On a success, it takes half damage and isn't knocked prone.

- **Beast's Call:** As an action, you can summon spectral beasts to fight for you. You summon a number of beasts (from the *conjure animals* spell list) whose combined CR doesn't exceed 2. They appear within 60 feet, act on your turn, obey your commands, and last for 10 minutes.

You can use Channel Divinity twice between rests. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.


#### STORM WALKER (6TH LEVEL)

Starting at 6th level, you embody Sylvara's storm-nature. You gain the following benefits:

- **Lightning Step:** When you take the Dash action, you can teleport up to your speed instead of moving. When you appear, lightning strikes around you. Each creature within 5 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 lightning damage on a failed save.

- **Weather Sense:** You always know what the weather will be for the next 24 hours. You can cast *fog cloud* and *gust of wind* at will without expending spell slots.


#### SYLVARA'S AVATAR (10TH LEVEL)

At 10th level, you can briefly become an avatar of the Wild. As an action, you transform for 1 minute, gaining the following benefits:

- You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed
- You have resistance to all damage except psychic
- Your druid spells that deal lightning or thunder damage deal an extra 1d8 damage
- You can use Wild Shape as a bonus action

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.


#### PRIMAL EMBODIMENT (14TH LEVEL)

At 14th level, you become the ultimate servant of Sylvara. You gain the following benefits:

- **Storm Form:** Your Wild Shape forms can be wreathed in lightning and wind. While in Wild Shape, you can use a bonus action to deal 2d6 lightning damage to all creatures within 5 feet of you.

- **Nature's Wrath:** You can cast *control weather* once without expending a spell slot. Once you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

- **Sylvara's Champion:** You have advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects. Beasts never willingly attack you.


#### TIRVANDOR CONTEXT

**Origin:** Sacred groves dedicated to Sylvara, wild places

**Culture:** These druids are Sylvara's chosen servants, seen as her voice in the natural world. They're more aggressive than typical druids, viewing civilization's expansion as an affront to the Wild. They're revered by rangers and feared by loggers.

**Philosophy:** "The Wild is not gentle. Sylvara is not kind. We are her storm."

**In Campaigns:**
- **Blood & Coin:** Challenging - anti-civilization can conflict with urban jobs
- **Shattered Oaths:** Good - primal champion against corrupting forces

---

## DESIGN NOTES

**Balance:**

**Contested Lands:**
- Battlefield Adaptation provides utility and Wild Shape variety
- War-Touched Magic is flavor with moderate power
- Contested Ground is strong control, limited to short rest
- Guardian of the Border is strong but at 14th level

**Ascended Wild:**
- Sylvara's Blessing provides expanded beast options and resistance
- Channel Divinity gives druids more martial options
- Storm Walker is mobile and deals moderate damage
- Primal Embodiment is a powerful capstone

Both provide unique druid experiences tied to Tirvandor!

---

- Veteran's Expertise provides survivability

**Royal Guard:**
- Guardian's Stance is strong protection ability with limited uses
- Formation Fighter rewards tactical positioning
- Elite Guardian's Intercept is powerful but risky
- Champion of Thaldros provides leadership and protection

Both offer distinct tactical styles—adaptable mercenary vs protective guardian!

\page

{{wide
## WAY OF THE BROKEN CHAIN (Monk)
}}


*Monks who escaped slavery or imprisonment, using martial discipline to resist oppression*

Monks of the Broken Chain learned their discipline in the worst circumstances—as slaves, prisoners, or captives. They use their ki to break bonds, resist control, and free others. Many come from Thaldros's prisons or labor camps, making them champions of freedom in Aethoria.

At 17th level, you become the ultimate liberator. You gain the following benefits:

- **Mass Liberation:** As an action, you can spend 5 ki points to release a wave of liberating energy. All creatures of your choice within 30 feet immediately end all conditions affecting them (charmed, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, restrained, or stunned), and all restraints (magical or nonmagical) break.

- **Freedom's Champion:** Once per turn when you hit with an unarmed strike, you deal an extra 1d10 force damage if the target is an authority figure, slaver, jailer, or tyrant (DM's discretion).


#### TIRVANDOR CONTEXT

**Origin:** Former slaves, escaped prisoners, freed captives (primarily from Thaldros)

**Culture:** These monks are heroes in Aethoria, where they help escaped slaves and fight against Thaldros's oppression. They're hunted as terrorists in Thaldros. Many join revolutionary movements.

**Philosophy:** "No chains can hold the determined spirit. Freedom is won, never given."

**In Campaigns:**
- **Blood & Coin:** Good - hired to free captives, break into prisons
- **Shattered Oaths:** EXCELLENT - perfect freedom fighter archetype

---


\page

{{wide
## WAY OF THE COIN (Monk)
}}


*Mercenary martial artists who blend ki mastery with calculated violence for profit*

Not all monks seek enlightenment—some seek gold. Monks of the Coin are pragmatic warriors who use their ki for mercenary work. They're professional fighters who've turned their martial discipline into a lucrative career, common in the Border's mercenary companies.


#### MERCENARY ARTS (3RD LEVEL)

When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn to blend commerce with combat. You gain the following benefits:

- **Professional's Focus:** When you begin combat, you can designate one creature as your contract target. You deal an extra 1d6 damage to that target with your unarmed strikes and monk weapons. This lasts until the target drops to 0 hit points or combat ends.

- **Coin-Fueled Ki:** Whenever you spend at least 100 gp on yourself (equipment, training, luxuries, etc.) during downtime, you gain 1 additional ki point that lasts until expended or until you finish a long rest (maximum +3 ki points from this feature).

- **Calculated Strike:** When you hit with a Flurry of Blows attack, you can forgo one attack to study your opponent. You learn one of the following: their AC, their remaining hit points (approximate), one damage resistance, or one damage vulnerability.


#### BOUNTY HUNTER'S TECHNIQUE (6TH LEVEL)

Starting at 6th level, you've mastered techniques for capturing and eliminating targets:

- **Non-Lethal Expert:** When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with an unarmed strike, you can choose to knock them unconscious instead of killing them. They're stable.

- **Marked for Gold:** You can spend 2 ki points to mark a creature you can see within 60 feet. For the next hour, you always know the direction and distance to the marked creature as long as it's on the same plane. The mark ends if you mark a different creature.

- **Mercenary's Speed:** You can spend 1 ki point as a bonus action to double your speed until the end of your turn, and opportunity attacks against you have disadvantage.


#### COIN'S BLESSING (11TH LEVEL)

At 11th level, your mercenary success brings supernatural luck:

- **Gold-Touched:** When you have at least 1,000 gp on your person, you have advantage on Charisma checks and death saving throws.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

- **Efficient Killer:** When you hit your contract target (from Professional's Focus), you can spend 2 ki points to force it to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it's stunned until the end of your next turn.


#### MASTER MERCENARY (17TH LEVEL)

At 17th level, you become a legendary mercenary monk:

- **Assassin's Precision:** The extra damage from Professional's Focus increases to 2d6, and you score critical hits against your contract target on a roll of 18-20.

- **Payment in Blood:** Once per turn, when you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you gain 2 ki points (maximum 5 extra ki points per long rest from this feature).


#### TIRVANDOR CONTEXT

**Origin:** Border mercenary companies, Iron Guild monasteries

**Culture:** These monks are professional fighters who view ki as a tool, not a spiritual path. They're respected in the Border as effective, reliable mercenaries. Some view them as sellouts; others as pragmatists.

**Philosophy:** "Enlightenment doesn't pay the bills. Excellence does."

**In Campaigns:**
- **Blood & Coin:** PERFECT - quintessential mercenary monk
- **Shattered Oaths:** Challenging - requires character growth from mercenary to hero

---

## DESIGN NOTES

**Balance:**

**Way of the Broken Chain:**
- Unbound Spirit provides utility and condition removal

- Chains of Retribution flips oppression back on oppressors
- Avatar of Freedom is powerful capstone for liberation theme

**Way of the Coin:**
- Professional's Focus similar to Kensei's bonus damage
- Coin-Fueled Ki is flavorful and rewards mercenary lifestyle
- Bounty Hunter's Technique provides utility
- Master Mercenary is strong but appropriate for 17th level

Both provide unique monk experiences tied to Tirvandor!

**Next: Paladin (Oath of the Iron Crown & Oath of Liberty)**


---

---


\page

{{wide
## OATH OF THE IRON CROWN (Paladin)
}}


*Paladins who serve Thaldros, enforcing law, order, and the king's will through strength*

Paladins of the Iron Crown are the armored fist of Thaldros. They swear to uphold law, maintain order, and enforce the king's authority. While some are noble protectors, others become instruments of oppression—their oath doesn't distinguish between justice and tyranny, only between order and chaos.


#### TENETS OF THE IRON CROWN

The tenets of the Oath of the Iron Crown bind a paladin to the principles of law, order, and authority.

**Order Above All.** Chaos is the enemy. Law must be maintained at any cost.

**Obey Authority.** The king's word is law. Legitimate authority must be obeyed and protected.

**Strength Through Discipline.** Power comes from order and unity, not individual glory.

**Punish the Lawless.** Those who break the law must face justice swiftly and without mercy.


#### OATH SPELLS

You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

| Paladin Level | Spells |
|---------------|--------|
| 3rd | *command*, *compelled duel* |
| 5th | *hold person*, *zone of truth* |
| 9th | *counterspell*, *dispel magic* |
| 13th | *banishment*, *compulsion* |
| 17th | *dominate person*, *hold monster* |


#### CHANNEL DIVINITY: VOICE OF AUTHORITY (3RD LEVEL)

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following Channel Divinity options:

**Crown's Command:** As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity to speak with absolute authority. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet that can hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to obey a one-word command on its next turn (as per *command*). This affects any creature type.

**Enforce the Law:** As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity to mark a lawbreaker. Choose one creature within 60 feet that has broken a law you're aware of. For 1 minute, you have advantage on attack rolls against the target, and it has disadvantage on saves against your spells.


#### AURA OF ORDER (7TH LEVEL)

Starting at 7th level, you emanate an aura of absolute discipline. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be charmed or frightened, and have advantage on saves to maintain concentration.

At 18th level, the range increases to 30 feet.


#### IRON JUDGMENT (15TH LEVEL)

At 15th level, your strikes enforce the law itself. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can force it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, choose one:

- The target is paralyzed until the end of your next turn
- The target must tell the truth for the next minute (as *zone of truth*)
- The target is compelled to cease hostile action for 1 minute (it can defend itself but can't attack)

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.


#### AVATAR OF AUTHORITY (20TH LEVEL)

At 20th level, you can assume the mantle of ultimate authority. As an action, you transform for 1 minute, gaining the following benefits:

- You emanate a 30-foot aura. Enemies in the aura have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.
- You have advantage on all Charisma checks and saving throws.
- When an enemy in your aura makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the roll (no limit).
- You can cast *command* at will without expending spell slots.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.


#### TIRVANDOR CONTEXT

**Origin:** Thaldros royal paladins, trained in the capital

**Culture:** Iron Crown paladins are both revered and feared in Thaldros. They're symbols of the crown's power—defenders of order who can also be instruments of oppression. They enforce the law without question, making them heroes to law-abiding citizens and tyrants to rebels.

**Moral Complexity:** This oath is LAWFUL above all else, but not necessarily GOOD. An Iron Crown paladin might:
- Heroically defend citizens from bandits
- Ruthlessly suppress peaceful protests  
- Protect the innocent from criminals
- Hunt escaped slaves as "lawbreakers"

**The oath doesn't fall for enforcing unjust laws—it's about order vs chaos, not good vs evil.**

**In Campaigns:**
- **Blood & Coin:** Complex - former Iron Crown turned mercenary, questioning their oath
- **Shattered Oaths:** EXCELLENT - perfect antagonist OR defector seeking redemption

## OATH OF LIBERTY (Paladin)
}}


*Paladins who champion freedom, break chains, and fight tyranny with righteous fury*

Paladins of Liberty are champions of the oppressed, breakers of chains, and living symbols of hope. They swear to fight tyranny wherever it exists, free the enslaved, and ensure all people can live without fear of oppression. They're heroes in Aethoria and criminals in Thaldros.


#### TENETS OF LIBERTY

The tenets of the Oath of Liberty guide a paladin to fight for freedom and justice.

**Freedom is Sacred.** All beings have the right to be free. No chains are legitimate.

**Resist Tyranny.** Oppression must be opposed, regardless of the cost.

**Give Hope.** Be a beacon to the oppressed. Show them freedom is possible.

**Break the Chains.** Free those in bondage, whether physical, mental, or spiritual.


#### OATH SPELLS

You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

| Paladin Level | Spells |
|---------------|--------|
| 3rd | *heroism*, *sanctuary* |
| 5th | *aid*, *lesser restoration* |
| 9th | *beacon of hope*, *remove curse* |
| 13th | *freedom of movement*, *guardian of faith* |
| 17th | *greater restoration*, *dispel evil and good* |


#### CHANNEL DIVINITY: LIBERATOR'S BLESSING (3RD LEVEL)

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following Channel Divinity options:

**Break the Chains:** As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity to free yourself and allies. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet immediately ends all conditions affecting them (charmed, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, or restrained). Additionally, all restraints (magical or nonmagical) within the area break.

**Champion of the Oppressed:** As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity to become a beacon of hope. For 1 minute, you and allies within 10 feet have advantage on saves against being charmed or frightened, and you all gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your paladin level (minimum 1) at the start of your turn.


#### AURA OF FREEDOM (7TH LEVEL)

Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be grappled or restrained, and your movement speed can't be reduced by magical means. Additionally, difficult terrain doesn't cost extra movement.

At 18th level, the range increases to 30 feet.


#### SMITE THE OPPRESSOR (15TH LEVEL)

At 15th level, your divine strikes punish tyrants. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend a spell slot to deal additional radiant damage as per Divine Smite. If the target is an authority figure who oppresses others (slavers, tyrants, corrupt officials, etc.—DM's discretion), you deal the maximum damage for the Divine Smite instead of rolling.

- When a creature starts its turn in the bright light, you can use your reaction to either heal it for 2d10 hit points or deal 2d10 radiant damage to it.
- Your weapon attacks deal an extra 2d8 radiant damage.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.


#### TIRVANDOR CONTEXT

**Origin:** Aethoria (primarily), escaped slaves, revolutionary groups

**Culture:** Liberty paladins are living legends in Aethoria—symbols of resistance against Thaldros. They raid slave camps, protect refugees, and inspire revolutionary movements. Songs are sung about them. Children dream of becoming them.

**In Thaldros:** They're hunted as terrorists and traitors. Bounties on Liberty paladins are enormous.

**Philosophy:** "Every chain broken is a victory. Every freed soul is sacred. Every tyrant defeated is justice."

**In Campaigns:**
- **Blood & Coin:** Good - mercenary who fights for freedom (conflicted about payment)
- **Shattered Oaths:** PERFECT - THE heroic paladin archetype for this campaign

---

## DESIGN NOTES

**Balance:**

**Oath of the Iron Crown:**
- Voice of Authority provides control and marking abilities
- Aura of Order is strong defensive aura
- Iron Judgment is powerful control ability
- Avatar of Authority is extremely strong but appropriate for 20th level

**Oath of Liberty:**
- Liberator's Blessing provides condition removal and support
- Aura of Freedom prevents control effects
- Smite the Oppressor rewards targeting oppressors
- Revolutionary Ascendance is powerful protective capstone

**Thematic Contrast:**
- Iron Crown: Control, authority, enforcement
- Liberty: Freedom, protection, inspiration

These oaths represent the ideological conflict at the heart of Tirvandor!

**Beast Swarm:** Spectral beasts attack all enemies within range. Each target must make a Strength saving throw, taking 4d8 piercing damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. Creatures that fail are also knocked prone.

**Thorned Ground:** The ground erupts with thorns and roots. The area becomes difficult terrain, and each enemy creature in the area takes 2d8 piercing damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by grasping vines until the start of your next turn.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.

## DESIGN NOTES

**Balance Considerations:**

All spells are designed to be:
- **Comparable in power** to official spells of the same level
- **Thematically appropriate** for Tirvandor
- **Mechanically sound** within 5e rules
- **Flavorful** without being overpowered

**Spell Schools:**
- Enchantment: 6 spells (manipulation, control)
- Abjuration: 3 spells (protection, freedom)
- Evocation: 1 spell (damage)
- Divination: 2 spells (awareness, tactics)
- Conjuration: 1 spell (summoning)
- Necromancy: 1 spell (life force)
- Transmutation: 1 spell (chaos magic)

**Power Level:**
- Slightly stronger than baseline for signature subclass spells
- Balanced by specificity (only certain subclasses get them)
- Most have drawbacks or limitations
- Higher level spells (3rd+) are appropriately powerful

**Integration:**
These spells should be automatically added to the spell lists of the subclasses noted above. Players don't need to choose them—they're part of the subclass features or expanded spell lists.

# APPENDIX A: CONDITIONS

Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster's attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.

A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.

If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's effects don't get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn't.

## PRONE

- A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition

# APPENDIX B: TIRVANDOR WORLD PRIMER

This appendix contains player-safe information about the world of Tirvandor. Your character would know most of this information as common knowledge.

---

## GEOGRAPHY

Tirvandor consists of two great continents separated by the Sundering Sea.

### THALDROS (THE WESTERN CONTINENT)

An authoritarian empire ruled by the Iron Crown from the capital city of Kaer Thandros. The land is organized, efficient, and tightly controlled.

**Major Cities:**
- **Kaer Thandros:** Imperial capital, seat of power
- **Goldreach:** Major port and trade hub
- **Ironhold:** Dwarven mountain fortress city

**Government:** Centralized monarchy with military enforcement

### AETHORIA (THE EASTERN CONTINENT)

A collection of democratic free states where personal liberty and self-governance reign. Less unified but more free than Thaldros.

**Major Cities:**
- **Aethermere:** Largest free city, council-governed
- **Silverpine:** University city, center of learning
- **Various settlements:** Each self-governing

**Government:** Democratic councils and elected leaders

### THE CONTESTED LANDS (THE BORDER)

The lawless region between Thaldros and Aethoria where neither side holds control. Home to refugees, mercenaries, bandits, and those who've chosen freedom over allegiance to either side.

### THE SUNDERING SEA

The magical sea that separates the two continents, created by the catastrophic Worldrend event 800 years ago. Difficult to cross, full of magical anomalies.

---

## HISTORY

### THE AGE OF UNITY (Ancient Past)

Before the Worldrend, Tirvandor was one unified land. The details are lost to time, but legends speak of a golden age.

### THE SUNDERING (800 Years Ago)

A catastrophic magical event tore the world in two, creating the Sundering Sea. The cause is debated - some blame hubris, others blame the gods. What's certain is that millions died and civilization collapsed.

### THE AGE OF CHAINS (700-400 Years Ago)

Following the Worldrend, warlords and tyrants rose to power. Might made right, and common folk suffered under brutal rule.

### THE LIBERATION (400 Years Ago)

In Aethoria, a revolutionary movement overthrew the tyrants and established democratic governance. This event is celebrated as the founding of free Aethoria.

### THE IRON CROWN ERA (200 Years Ago - Present)

In Thaldros, the Iron Crown consolidated power and established the current empire. Thaldros claims to bring order and stability; Aethoria calls it tyranny.

### THE PRESENT DAY

Tensions between Thaldros and Aethoria remain high. The Contested Lands grow more dangerous. Strange magical phenomena increase near ley lines. Your adventure begins in this uncertain time.

---

## MAGIC

Magic in Tirvandor flows through **ley lines** - natural channels of magical energy that crisscross the world.

### LEY LINES

- Visible to those trained to see them
- Enhance spellcasting when tapped into
- Connect to the world's creation and the Worldrend
- Converge at nexus points of immense power
- Unstable in the Contested Lands

### MAGIC USERS

- **Wizards:** Study ley line theory and manipulation
- **Sorcerers:** Born with natural attunement to ley lines
- **Clerics/Paladins:** Channel divine power through ley lines
- **Druids:** Work with natural ley line flows
- **Warlocks:** Patrons grant access to forbidden ley energies

### THE SILVER CIRCLE

An organization of mages dedicated to studying and protecting ley lines. Politically neutral, they maintain a presence in both Thaldros and Aethoria.

---

## THE SEVEN PRIMORDIALS (GODS)

The gods of Tirvandor are called the Seven Primordials - ancient beings who shaped the world.

1. **Aethor** - Liberation, freedom, revolution (Good)
2. **Sylvara** - Nature, wilderness, growth (Neutral)
3. **Volcanus** - Forge, craft, creation (Neutral Good)
4. **Mordain** - Law, order, justice (Lawful Neutral)
5. **Corvus** - Knowledge, secrets, death (Neutral)
6. **Glacius** - Preservation, endurance (Neutral)
7. **Teraxis** - Change, ambition, progress (Chaotic Neutral)

Most people in Tirvandor worship all Seven depending on need, though individuals may favor one over others.

---

## FACTIONS

### THE IRON GUILD

A massive mercenary organization operating in the Contested Lands. Politically neutral, they provide military services to anyone who can pay. Led by Garrick Ironheart from Goldreach.

### THE THORNWOOD SYNDICATE

Criminal network operating across both continents. Smuggling, information brokering, and "off the books" services. Led by Lyanna Thornwood (The Red Wolf).

### THE SILVER CIRCLE

Mage organization protecting ley lines and studying magic. Neutral in politics, essential for magical research.

### THE IRON LEGION

Military force of Thaldros. Disciplined, well-equipped, and loyal to the Iron Crown.

### THE PEOPLE'S COUNCILS

Democratic governing bodies of Aethoria. Each city has its own council elected by citizens.

---

## CURRENCY AND ECONOMY

Standard D&D currency applies:

- **Gold pieces (gp)**
- **Platinum pieces (pp)**

**Economic Notes:**
