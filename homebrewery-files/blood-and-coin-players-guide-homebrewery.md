# BLOOD & COIN: PLAYER'S GUIDE

## CAMPAIGN OVERVIEW

### WHAT IS BLOOD & COIN?
Blood & Coin is a mercenary-focused campaign set in the Border region of Thaldros—a contested frontier zone between the Kingdom's central authority and independent territories. You play professional fighters-for-hire working for the Iron Guild, taking contracts from anyone with gold to spend. This is a morally gray campaign where money talks, loyalty is negotiable, and survival depends on your skills and reputation.
Core Themes:
Professional mercenary work
Moral ambiguity and gray choices
Reputation and consequences
Gold and contracts over idealism
Tactical combat and strategic thinking
Inter-party dynamics and trust
Campaign Tone:
Gritty and pragmatic
Dark humor and gallows wit
Action-focused with intrigue
Morally complex situations
High combat, medium role play, medium exploration

## WHO YOU ARE

### THE IRON GUILD
You are members of (or affiliated with) the Iron Guild, the largest and most respected mercenary organization in the Border. The Guild operates under strict professional standards:
The Guild Code:
1. Honor Contracts – A contract, once signed, is sacred
2. No Betrayal – Never betray your squad or employer (during the contract)
3. Fair Payment – Good work deserves good pay
4. Professional Conduct – Mercenaries, not bandits
5. Reputation Matters – Your word is your bond
What This Means:
You're professionals, not murder-hobos
You can refuse any contract before signing
Once you sign, you fulfill it (or face consequences)
You can work for anyone: Thaldros, Aethoria, merchants, nobles, criminals
Your reputation affects future contracts and pay rates

## CHARACTER CREATION GUIDE

Role: Versatile combatant, leader
Personality: Disciplined, strategic, respected
THE SPECIALIST

### STEP 2: CHOOSE RACE
All races work, but some fit the mercenary life better:

Half-Orc – Respected for strength. "Hired muscle" stereotype but well-paid.
Dwarf – Reliable, tough. Good reputation in the Guild.
Half-Elf – Adaptable, good with people. Excellent negotiators.
GOOD CHOICES:
Dragonborn – Intimidating, loyal. Sought after for elite squads.
Tiefling – Distrusted by some, but talent talks. Lower starting reputation.
Halfling – Underestimated, which can be an advantage. Good scouts.
CHALLENGING (But Playable):
Elf – Seen as aloof or too "noble." Must prove yourself.
Gnome – Rare in mercenary work. Better as support/magic specialists.

### STEP 3: SELECT CLASS & SUBCLASS

Rogue – Assassin – Professional killer
Warlock – Pact of War Profiteer – Dark power from conflict
GOOD CHOICES: ⭐
Most other subclasses work with the right backstory
Ex–soldiers, former criminals, outcasts, refugees
Anyone who needs money and can fight
CHALLENGING (Requires Justification):
Paladin – Oath of Devotion – Hard to be idealistic mercenary
Paladin – Oath of Liberty – Freedom fighter, not mercenary

### STEP 5: MOTIVATIONS
Why are you a mercenary?
Choose 1-2 motivations. These drive your character:
PRAGMATIC MOTIVATIONS:
Need Money – Survival, debts, family support
Best Option – War refugee, no other skills
Professional Pride – You're good at this, why quit?
Adventure – Beats farming or shop-keeping
Reputation – Building a name in the Guild
DEEPER MOTIVATIONS:
Running From Past – War crimes, failures, lost love
Seeking Someone – Lost family, enemy, old friend
Revenge – Against nation, person, organization (be careful)
Redemption – Trying to be better than you were
Ideals – Money is means to an end (free homeland, etc.)
DARK MOTIVATIONS:
Love of Violence – You enjoy combat (don't be edgy)
Power – Money = power, and you want it
Survival – Kill or be killed mindset
Nihilism – Nothing matters but gold and blood

### STEP 6: SQUAD BONDS
You're part of a mercenary squad. How do you know each other?
Choose or roll 1d8:
1. Veterans – Served together in previous contracts
2. Guild Training – Met during Iron Guild recruitment/training
3. Saved Each Other – One saved another's life in combat
4. Recommended – A mutual contact brought you together
5. Former Enemies – Fought on opposite sides once, now allies
6. Family/Friends – Preexisting relationship outside mercenary work
7. Strangers – Just assigned to same squad by the Guild
8. Shared Trauma – Survived something terrible together
Important: You trust your squad (at least professionally). Mercenaries who betray their own don't last long.

## MORAL CHOICES & CONSEQUENCES

### THE MERCENARY'S DILEMMA
You will face hard choices:
Example Scenarios:

Well-paying client wants you to recapture escaped slaves
Legal in Thaldros, profitable, but morally wrong
Refuse = lost money + possible reputation hit
Accept = good pay + moral stain
2. The Civilian Question

Depot is in a civilian town
Collateral damage likely
How far do you go?
3. The Better Offer
Mid-contract, enemy offers double to switch sides
No one would know...
But your reputation...
4. The Squad vs. Contract
Contract demands you leave wounded squad mate
Saving them means failing contract
What matters more?
There Are No Perfect Answers
Every choice has consequences
Your character's values will be tested
The DM won't judge your choices
But the world will react to them

## SETTING INFORMATION

### THE BORDER REGION
Where You Operate:
The Border is a 50-mile-wide strip of frontier land where the Thaldros Crown's authority fades and independent settlements govern themselves. Neither side fully controls it, making it a haven for:
Mercenaries (like you)
Smugglers and traders
Refugees from both Kingdom and frontier
Bandits and criminals
Independent settlements
The Conflict:
The Thaldros Kingdom wants to bring the frontier under royal control, while the frontier territories fight to remain independent. Neither can afford full-scale war, so they use mercenaries, economic pressure, and political maneuvering. The Border is where this cold war plays out.
The International Angle:
The frontier territories watch this conflict carefully, weighing their options. Some leaders dream of true independence, others seek better terms with the Crown. Rumors say Aethoria across the Sundering Sea watches with interest, perhaps seeing opportunity in Thaldros divided against itself.
Major Border Towns:
Crossroads (Population: 3,000)
Largest Border settlement
Iron Guild headquarters
Neutral ground for all factions
Your home base
Grimwatch (Population: 800)
Fortified trading post
Kingdom loyalist settlement
Good for royal military contracts
Freehold (Population: 1,200)
Independent village
Sympathetic to democratic ideals (Aethoria influence)
Lots of frontier refugee work

### THE IRON GUILD

Founded 50 years ago by veteran soldiers tired of war, the Iron Guild is the most respected mercenary organization in Tirvandor.

Guildmaster: Oversees all operations

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
Q: Can I be a good person in this campaign?
A: Yes! Many mercenaries have moral codes. You choose which contracts to take.
Q: Will we be forced to do evil things?
A: No. You can refuse any contract. But refusing loses potential income and some contracts may test your morals.
Q: Can we switch sides during a contract?
A: Technically yes, but expect severe reputation consequences. The Guild Code forbids it.
Q: What if my character wouldn't take a contract?
A: Then don't! But have an in-character reason and accept the consequences.
Q: Can we work for both Kingdom forces and frontier territories?
A: Absolutely. The Guild is neutral. Your only loyalty is to gold and the current contract.
Q: How lethal is this campaign?
A: Moderately lethal. Combat is dangerous but healers are available. Smart play keeps you alive.
Q: Can I play a pacifist?
A: Very difficult in a mercenary campaign. Consider a support role (healer, face) instead.
Q: What if we want to eventually pick a side?
A: That's an option! The campaign can evolve based on your choices.
