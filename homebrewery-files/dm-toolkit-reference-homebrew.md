## GENERATIONAL PERSPECTIVE

**How long ago was the Sundering?**

**In Elf Years:**
- About 6-7 elf lifespans
- Some elves alive remember great-grandparents who survived it
- High Queen Aelindra: born 760 years AFTER Sundering

**In Human Years:**
- About 30-40 generations
- Ancient history, like Bronze Age to us
- No living human has living memory of it

**In Dwarf Years:**
- About 10-12 dwarf lifespans
- Clan histories record it clearly
- Some artifacts from before still in use

**Cultural Impact:**
- Humans: Distant history, mythical
- Elves: Recent tragedy, still healing
- Dwarves: Recorded fact, grudges maintained

---

# SESSION ZERO MATERIALS
## Starting Your Tirvandor Campaign

**Use these materials for:** New campaign kickoff, player onboarding, setting expectations

---

## WORLD PRIMER (Player Handout)

### Welcome to Tirvandor: The Realm of Deep Magic

**What is Tirvandor?**

Tirvandor is a world where magic flows through ancient ley lines like rivers beneath the earth, where two great continents were once joined until a catastrophic event known as the Sundering split them apart. Three thousand years later, the kingdoms of Thaldros and Aethoria remain divided—not by distance, but by pride, philosophy, and old wounds that refuse to heal.

---

## THE WORLD AT A GLANCE

### Geography

**Two Continents:**
- **THALDROS (West)** - Human-dominated kingdom, military might, fortress cities
- **AETHORIA (East)** - Elven republic, magical excellence, ancient wisdom
- **THE SUNDERING SEA** - Separates the continents, dangerous waters, ruins beneath

**Key Regions:**
- **Ironspine Mountains** - Natural border, dwarf strongholds, rich mines
- **Thornwood Forest** - Ancient woods, ranger territory, druidic circles
- **Ashmar Wastes** - Volcanic badlands, fire magic, dangerous seals
- **Sundara Desert** - Oasis city-states, desert nomads, ancient mysteries

---

## THE POLITICAL SITUATION

**The Great Divide:**

The kingdoms were once united under a single banner. Then came the Sundering—an arcane catastrophe that literally split the landmass in two. Each side blames the other. Each side has legitimate grievances. Both want reunification, but on their terms.

**Thaldros Kingdom** (West - Humans)
- **Ruler:** King Aldric IV Thandris
- **Philosophy:** Strength, honor, military might
- **Goal:** Reunification through power and tradition
- **Capital:** Kaer Thandros (fortress-city)

**Aethoria Republic** (East - Elves)
- **Ruler:** High Queen Aelindra Aethermere  
- **Philosophy:** Wisdom, patience, magical knowledge
- **Goal:** Reunification through enlightenment and time
- **Capital:** Aethermere (crystalline city)

**The Tension:** A cold war of ideologies. Not open warfare, but proxy conflicts, border skirmishes, and political maneuvering. Your actions could tip the balance.

---

## MAJOR FACTIONS

You don't have to join a faction, but understanding them helps navigate the world:

**The Iron Council** (Military Alliance)
- Defenders of the realm against external threats
- Values: Honor, duty, sacrifice
- Led by: Lord Commander Gareth Lightbane (Paladin)

**The Merchant League** (Economic Power)
- Controls trade routes and wealth
- Values: Profit, influence, opportunity
- Led by: Trade Prince Lucian Goldfingers

**The Syndicate** (Criminal Network)
- Operates in shadows, controls black market
- Values: Secrets, power, survival
- Led by: Master Crimson (identity unknown)

**The Ashwardens** (Volcanic Guardians)
- Maintain seals preventing eruptions
- Values: Duty, sacrifice, vigilance
- Led by: Grand Warden Volcanus Rex (Fire Genasi)

**Ironspine Rangers** (Wilderness Protectors)
- Defend nature from civilization's expansion
- Values: Balance, preservation, freedom
- Led by: Warden Commander Thalia Moonbow (Wood Elf)

**Others:** Druidic Circle, Forgebound Guild, Aethorian Council
