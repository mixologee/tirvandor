## Campaign Use

The Primordial threat is the ultimate story backbone. Everything connects to the approaching crisis and the need to prevent a second Sundering.
\page
# Part II: Running the Game
# Chapter 1: Core Mechanics and Adjudication
## Ability Checks
### When to Call for Checks

Call for ability checks when:
- The outcome is uncertain
- Both success and failure have interesting consequences
- The action takes significant effort or skill

Don't call for checks when:
- The outcome is certain (routine tasks for skilled characters)
- Failure would just stop the story with no interesting outcome
- Success is impossible regardless of roll

### Setting Difficulty Classes

| Difficulty | DC | Example |
|------------|-----|---------|
| Very Easy | 5 | Notice something obvious, climb a knotted rope |
| Easy | 10 | Hear an approaching guard, climb a surface with ledges |
| Medium | 15 | Eavesdrop through a door, scale a brick wall |
| Hard | 20 | Hear a whisper through a door, climb a slippery sheer surface |
| Very Hard | 25 | Hear breathing through a door, climb an oiled wall |
| Nearly Impossible | 30 | Read lips from across a plaza, climb a perfectly smooth surface |

Most checks should be DC 15 (Medium). Reserve DC 25+ for legendary feats.

### Multiple Ability Options

When a task could use multiple abilities, let players describe their approach:

Example: Getting Past a Guard
- Strength (Athletics): Overpower and restrain
- Dexterity (Stealth): Sneak past without being seen
- Charisma (Deception): Convince guard you belong there
- Charisma (Intimidation): Threaten guard into letting you pass
- Intelligence (Investigation): Find alternate route by studying patrol patterns
- Wisdom (Insight): Determine when guard is distracted

The player's description determines which ability applies. Reward creative thinking.

### Group Checks

When the whole party attempts something together (crossing a rope bridge, sneaking past guards, rowing a boat in storm):

Method 1: Simple Majority
Everyone rolls. If more than half succeed, the group succeeds.

Method 2: Leader + Help
One character leads (rolls), others who succeed on DC 10 checks give advantage through the Help action.

Method 3: Best Applies
When one character's success helps everyone (ranger navigating, rogue scouting ahead), use the best result.

### Contests

When two creatures oppose each other (arm wrestling, chase, hiding vs seeking):
- Both roll appropriate ability checks
- Highest total wins
- Ties go to the creature with higher ability modifier
- If still tied, reroll

## Advantage and Disadvantage
### When to Grant Advantage

Favorable Circumstances:
- High ground in combat
- Target is restrained, prone, or unconscious
- Ally provides Help action
- Environmental factor aids the task (bright light for Perception, etc.)
- Creative player solution that makes sense

Don't Stack: Multiple sources of advantage don't stack. You either have it or you don't.
{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote Part II: Running the Game}}
\page
### When to Impose Disadvantage

Unfavorable Circumstances:
- Attacking while prone
- Attacker is blinded or can't see target
- Target has cover (for attacks)
- Environmental hindrance (darkness for Perception, noise for Stealth)
- Exhaustion levels 1-2
- Task is being rushed

Don't Stack: Multiple sources don't stack.



### Advantage/Disadvantage Cancel

If you have both advantage and disadvantage from any sources, they cancel completely. Roll one d20 normally, regardless of how many sources of each you have.

---

## Combat

### Initiative

Rolling Initiative:

| Roll | Result |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Situation becomes combat (violence is inevitable, trap springs, ambush happens) |
| 2 | Everyone rolls d20 + Dexterity modifier |
| 3 | DM ranks all combatants from highest to lowest |
| 4 | Ties: PCs win ties with monsters. Tied PCs/monsters choose their order. |


Tracking Initiative:
Write on paper or use tracker. Call out current turn and who's next: "Thea, you're up. Marcus, you're on deck."

Changing Initiative: Some DMs reroll each round. Others keep same order entire combat. Choose consistency.

---

## Improvisation

### When Players Surprise You

Stay Calm: Players going unexpected directions is normal and good. It means they're engaged.

Ask Clarifying Questions:
- "What's your goal here?"
- "How do you imagine this working?"
- "What are you hoping to find?"

Use "Yes, And...":
Instead of shutting down ideas, build on them:
- Player: "Can I swing from the chandelier?"
- Bad: "No, that's not in the rules."
- Good: "Yes! Make an Athletics check. If you fail, it breaks and you fall."

### Quick NPC Creation

When you need an NPC right now:

Name: Use name list or combine syllables
Distinctive Feature: One physical trait (scar, accent, nervous tic)
Goal: What do they want?
Secret: What are they hiding?

Example:
- Name: Kerra
- Feature: Missing left ear
- Goal: Get enough money to leave town
- Secret: Secretly works for Iron Guild

### Quick Room Description

When party enters unexpected room:

Size and Shape: Small/medium/large, square/rectangular/circular
Purpose: What was this room for? (Bedroom, storage, shrine, guard post)
Condition: Pristine/dusty/damaged/destroyed
Notable Feature: One interesting thing (murals, weapons rack, altar, fireplace)
Exists: Obvious doors/windows

Example:
"You enter a medium-sized rectangular room. Looks like a guard barracks - three cots along the wall, weapons rack (empty now). Everything's covered in dust. The interesting part: someone has scratched a map into the wooden table in the center. You see three doors - one ahead, two on the sides."

### Saying "No" Gracefully

Sometimes you must refuse player ideas:

Bad: "No, you can't do that."
Better: "That won't work because [reason], but what if you [alternative]?"

Example:
- Player: "I want to convince the king to abdicate."
- DM: "The king won't abandon his kingdom based on one conversation, but you could plant seeds of doubt about his advisors. Maybe he'd take action against corrupt officials?"

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote Part II: Running the Game}}
\page
## Pacing

### Recognizing Pacing Problems

Too Slow:
- Players checking phones
- Side conversations
- "What's happening?"
- Yawning
- Combat dragging

Too Fast:
- Players look confused
- Asking to repeat information
- Not engaging with scenes
- Feeling rushed

{{pag### Speeding Things Up

In Combat:
- Set turn timer (30-60 seconds)
- Roll multiple attacks together
- Describe outcomes cinematically
- Skip to interesting parts ("You fight through minions...")

In Exploration:
- Montage: "You spend three days traveling through forest. Anything specific you want to do?"
- Jump to next interesting scene
- Resolve routine tasks quickly

In Social Interaction:
- Get to the point: "What do you want from them?"
- Skip pleasantries unless character moment
- Resolve straightforward conversations in one roll

### Slowing Things Down

In Combat:
- Add description between turns
- Let players strategize briefly
- Ask what character is thinking/feeling

In Important Moments:
- Describe in detail
- Ask each player for their reaction
- Let scene breathe
- Allow roleplay

In Exploration:
- Add sensory details
- Ask "What are you looking for?"
- Zoom in on interesting features

### Scene Transitions

Cut Efficiently:
- "Three hours later..."
- "Meanwhile, at the castle..."
- "The next morning..."
- "After a week of travel..."

Don't play out every moment. Jump to interesting parts.

 ::

## Rulings Over Rules

### Making Fair Rulings

When situation isn't covered by rules:

1. Listen to player's intent
2. Determine appropriate ability + skill
3. Set DC based on difficulty
4. Consider advantage/disadvantage
5. Describe outcome based on roll

Note the ruling and apply it consistently afterward.

### When to Look Up Rules

Look it up:
- First time using complex rule
- Player challenges ruling
- Affects major outcome (death, TPK)

Don't look it up:
- Middle of intense moment
- Would break pacing
- You're reasonably sure of rule

Make ruling, note it, look it up after session.

### Admitting Mistakes

If you realize you ruled wrong:
- Acknowledge it: "I got that rule wrong."
- Correct it going forward: "From now on we'll do it this way."
- Don't retcon unless truly game-breaking
- Don't beat yourself up

---

## Using This Chapter

Reference these mechanics during play. Most important points:


| Roll | Result |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Most checks are DC 15 |
| 2 | Grant advantage/disadvantage liberally |
| 3 | Say "yes, and..." to player ideas |
| 4 | Keep combat moving |
| 5 | Cut boring parts, zoom into interesting parts |
| 6 | Make rulings, look up rules later |


The goal is fun and flow, not perfect rules mastery.

# Chapter 3: Creating Adventures
## Step-by-Step Adventure Design


## What Makes a Good Adventure

A good D&D adventure has:


| Roll | Result |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Clear Initial Hook: Players know why they're doing this |
| 2 | Meaningful Choices: Players decisions matter |
| 3 | Multiple Approaches: Combat isn't the only solution |
| 4 | Rising Tension: Stakes increase as adventure progresses |
| 5 | Satisfying Resolution: Clear ending with consequences |
| 6 | Player Agency: Players drive the story through their choices |


Bad adventure: Linear railroad with one solution

Good adventure: Situation with multiple possible outcomes based on player choices

---

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Establish the Premise (One Sentence)

What is this adventure about in one sentence?

Examples:
- "Rebels steal military supplies from Thaldros convoy"
- "Missing children lead to corrupt noble's secret"
- "Primordial corruption spreads from ancient ruin"
- "Rival factions compete for powerful artifact"

Good premises:
- Specific and actionable
- Have clear stakes
- Can be completed in 3-6 sessions

### Step 2: Identify the Villain or Threat

Who or what opposes the players?

Villain Checklist:
- Goal: What do they want?
- Method: How are they trying to achieve it?
- Weakness: How can they be stopped?
- Backup Plan: What if first plan fails?

Example: Captain Vex (Thaldros Officer)
- Goal: Capture Resistance leaders
- Method: Infiltrate with spies, set trap
- Weakness: Too confident, underestimates party
- Backup: Has reinforcements 1 hour away

Threat Checklist (Non-Villain):
- Source: Where does threat come from?
- Effect: What happens if not stopped?
- Solution: How can players stop it?
- Escalation: What if players fail or delay?

Example: Primordial Corruption
- Source: Weakened prison seal beneath city
- Effect: Citizens transform into spawns
- Solution: Reseal prison or evacuate city
- Escalation: More corrupted daily, eventually awakens Primordial

### Step 3: Design Key Locations

Identify 3-5 important locations for this adventure.

For Each Location:
- Purpose: What happens here?
- Description: What does it look/sound/smell like?
- Inhabitants: Who or what is here?
- Secrets: What's hidden here?
- Connections: How does this tie to other locations?

Example Locations:

| Roll | Result |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Resistance Safehouse - Party's base, information source |
| 2 | Thaldros Supply Depot - Target for heist |
| 3 | Border Crossing - Escape route, checkpoint encounter |
| 4 | Iron Guild Tavern - Neutral ground, negotiation possible |
| 5 | Primordial Ruin - Optional discovery, raises stakes |


### Step 4: Create Major NPCs

Design 3-5 important NPCs players will interact with.

For Each NPC:
- Name and Appearance: Distinctive feature
- Role: Ally? Enemy? Neutral?
- Goal: What do they want?
- Secret: What are they hiding?
- Offer: What can they give players?
- Ask: What do they want from players?

Example: Kerra the Smuggler
- Appearance: Missing left ear, nervous energy
- Role: Uneasy ally
- Goal: Make enough money to flee to Aethoria
- Secret: Secretly reports to Iron Guild
- Offer: Safe passage through checkpoint
- Ask: Cut of stolen supplies

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote Part II: Running the Game}}
\page


### Step 5: Build Encounters

Design 4-8 encounters mixing combat, social, and exploration.

Encounter Types:

Combat Encounters:
- Planned fights (guards, monsters)
- Dynamic battlefields (fire, falling, cover)
- Objectives beyond "kill everything" (protect NPC, hold position, escape)

Social Encounters:
- Negotiations with opposing factions
- Gathering information from NPCs
- Convincing someone to help

Exploration Encounters:
- Searching ruins for clues
- Navigating dangerous terrain
- Solving puzzles or riddles

Aim for Mix:
- 40% combat
- 30% social
- 30% exploration

### Step 6: Plan Rewards

What do players gain?

Types of Rewards:
- Gold and Treasure: Standard, use CR-based tables
- Magic Items: 1-2 per adventure (based on level)
- Information: Maps, letters, intelligence
- Contacts: New NPCs who owe them favors
- Reputation: Faction influence points
- Story Progress: Answers to mysteries, plot advancement

Balance: Don't over-reward or under-reward. Match party level.

### Step 7: Prepare for Player Choices

Anticipate 3-4 likely player approaches:

Example: Stealing Supplies

Approach 1: Stealth
- Sneak in at night
- Disable guards quietly
- Load supplies and escape

Approach 2: Social
- Forge documents
- Bribe or convince guards
- Walk out with "authorized" supplies

Approach 3: Combat
- Attack during escort
- Fight through guards
- Take supplies by force

Approach 4: Alternative
- Discover supplies going elsewhere
- Hijack alternate route
- Avoid main depot entirely

Don't force one approach. Reward creativity.

## Adventure Structures

### Location-Based Adventures

Adventure centers on exploring a place (dungeon, city, wilderness).

Structure:

| Roll | Result |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Entrance: How players get in |
| 2 | Zones: Different areas with different threats/themes |
| 3 | Factions: Groups within location (may ally, fight, or ignore players) |
| 4 | Goal: What players seek (rescue, artifact, information) |
| 5 | Exit: How players get out (may be different from entrance) |


Good For: Dungeons, ruins, fortresses, cities

Example: Ancient Primordial Prison
- Entrance: Through collapsed temple
- Zones: Outer wards, prison cells, seal chamber
- Factions: Cultists trying to break seal, corrupted prisoners, constructs still guarding
- Goal: Reseal prison before Primordial breaks free
- Exit: Teleportation circle in seal chamber (risky) or climb back out

### Event-Based Adventures

Adventure follows sequence of events. Location changes as events unfold.

Structure:

| Roll | Result |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Inciting Incident: Event that kicks everything off |
| 2 | Rising Action: Series of encounters/scenes building tension |
| 3 | Complication: Unexpected twist raises stakes |
| 4 | Climax: Final confrontation or decision |
| 5 | Resolution: Immediate consequences of player actions |


Good For: Heists, chases, time-sensitive missions

Example: Supply Convoy Heist
- Inciting Incident: Learn convoy leaving tomorrow
- Rising Action: Gather information, plan attack, prepare ambush
- Complication: Convoy has unexpected magical defense
- Climax: Battle for the supplies
- Resolution: Escape with supplies, deal with pursuit

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote Part II: Running the Game}}
\page


### Mystery Adventures

Adventure about uncovering truth. Players follow clues.

Structure:

| Roll | Result |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Crime/Mystery: Something happened, players investigate |
| 2 | Clues: Information pointing to suspects/locations |
| 3 | Red Herrings: False leads that seem promising |
| 4 | Revelation: Key discovery that clarifies situation |
| 5 | Confrontation: Confront culprit or reveal truth |
| 6 | Resolution: Justice, consequences, lingering questions |


Good For: Murders, conspiracies, missing persons

Example: Missing Children
- Crime: Five children vanished from Border village
- Clues: Footprints lead to noble's estate, children wore iron collars, witnessed strange lights
- Red Herrings: Local hermit seems suspicious, rumors of monsters
- Revelation: Noble conducting experiments on children for Primordial cult
- Confrontation: Infiltrate estate, rescue children, stop ritual
- Resolution: Noble arrested or escapes, cult exposed or stays hidden

Three-Clue Rule: For any key information players need, provide at least three different ways to find it. If they miss two, they'll still get it.

## Pacing and Tension

### Five-Act Structure

Act 1: Introduction (Session 1)
- Present hook
- Introduce key NPCs
- Establish stakes
- Give players clear short-term goal

Act 2: Rising Action (Session 1-2)

- Encounters increase in difficulty
- New information complicates situation
- Players make meaningful choices

Act 3: Midpoint Twist (Session 2-3)

- New threat or ally emerges
- Players must adapt plan

Act 4: Approaching Climax (Session 3-4)

- Point of no return
- All pieces come together
- Building to showdown

Act 5: Climax and Resolution (Session 4)
- Major encounter/decision
- All previous choices matter
- Clear victory or defeat conditions
- Immediate consequences
- Seeds for next adventure

### Building Tension

Early Adventure (Sessions 1-2):
- Easier encounters
- Success comes easier
- Players feel capable
- Information flows

Middle Adventure (Sessions 2-3):
- Harder encounters
- Complications arise
- Resources depleting
- Time pressure introduced

Late Adventure (Sessions 3-4):
- Hardest encounters
- Multiple threats at once
- Resources scarce
- High stakes, real danger

### Using Time Pressure

Introduce countdown or deadline:
- "Ritual completes in 3 days"
- "Convoy leaves at dawn"
- "Corruption spreading, infects 1d6 more citizens daily"

Each session: Advance the countdown. Make consequences clear.

If players delay: Bad things happen. Don't pull punches, but don't make it impossible either.

## Common Mistakes

### Railroad Adventures

Problem: Players have no real choices. One path only.

Fix: Always provide 2-3 ways to approach situations. Accept unexpected solutions.

### Killer DM

Problem: Adventure designed to kill players or "beat" them.

Fix: Challenge players, but give them tools to succeed. Death should result from bad choices, not unfair design.

### No Stakes

Problem: Nothing bad happens if players fail or delay.

Fix: Establish clear consequences. If players ignore quest, things get worse.

### Too Many NPCs

Problem: Players can't remember who's who.

Fix: Limit to 5-6 major NPCs per adventure. Give each distinctive feature.

### Info Dump

Problem: Pages of backstory dumped on players.

Fix: Reveal information through play. Show, don't tell. Let players discover it.

### Ignoring Player Choices

Problem: Players' decisions don't matter, everything leads to same outcome.

Fix: Make player choices have real consequences. Branch the adventure.

## Campaign Structure

### Episodic Campaigns

Structure: Self-contained adventures with recurring cast and setting

Pros:
- Easy for players to miss sessions
- Low commitment
- Clear endings
- Easy to run

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote Part II: Running the Game}}
\page


Cons:
- Less epic feeling
- Character development slower
- Lower stakes

Good For:
- New players
- Inconsistent schedules
- Shorter campaigns

Example: Iron Guild Mercenaries
Each adventure is a contract. Client hires party for job. Complete job, get paid, next job. Recurring clients, growing reputation, but each mission stands alone.

### Serialized Campaigns

Structure: Interconnected adventures building toward major conclusion

Pros:
- Epic scope
- Satisfying payoffs
- Character arcs
- High stakes

Cons:
- Harder if players miss sessions
- Requires long-term commitment
- More planning required

Good For:
- Experienced players
- Consistent group
- Long campaigns

Example: Stopping Primordial Awakening
Each adventure reveals more about Primordial threat. Party strengthens seals, fights cults, uncovers conspiracy, all building toward final confrontation with awakening entity.

### Hybrid Structure (Recommended)

Structure: Episodic adventures with serialized backbone

How It Works:
- Main story progresses in background
- Most sessions are self-contained adventures
- Every 3-4 adventures, major plot advancement
- Players can miss sessions without losing thread

Example: Resistance Campaign
Session 1-3: Rescue prisoners (self-contained)
Session 4: Discover Thaldros attack plans (plot advancement)
Sessions 5-7: Steal supplies (self-contained)
Session 8: Betrayed by ally working for enemy (plot advancement)
Sessions 9-11: Infiltrate enemy fortress (self-contained)
Session 12: Thaldros invasion begins (major plot event)

## Campaign Planning

### Before Session Zero

1. Choose Core Theme:
Pick primary focus (War, Primordials, Intrigue, Personal)

2. Decide Campaign Length:
- Short: 10-20 sessions (Levels 1-10)
- Medium: 20-40 sessions (Levels 1-15)
- Long: 40+ sessions (Levels 1-20)

3. Outline Major Arcs:
Break campaign into 3-5 major story arcs

Example - War Campaign (30 sessions):
- Arc 1 (Levels 1-5, 8 sessions): Join Resistance, local operations
- Arc 2 (Levels 6-10, 10 sessions): Faction intrigue, spy network
- Arc 3 (Levels 11-15, 10 sessions): Major battles, political upheaval
- Conclusion (Level 15-16, 2 sessions): Peace treaty or final victory

4. Identify Key NPCs:
Create 5-10 major NPCs who will recur throughout campaign:
- Allies (quest givers, mentors)
- Rivals (competing heroes or factions)
- Villains (antagonists, growing threat)
- Neutrals (Iron Guild, merchants, informants)

5. Establish Factions:
Identify which factions matter and their agendas

### Session Zero

Goals:
- Set table expectations
- Create characters together
- Establish connections
- Explain campaign themes
- Set tone and boundaries

Agenda:

1. Pitch the Campaign (15 minutes):
Describe setting, themes, and tone. Be honest about content.

"This campaign focuses on the Resistance against Thaldros occupation. Themes include:
- Moral ambiguity (no clear good/evil)
- Difficult choices with consequences
- Guerrilla warfare and espionage
- Personal sacrifice for greater good

Tone: Serious but with moments of levity. Gritty realism mixed with heroic fantasy."

2. Safety Tools (10 minutes):
Establish X-card, lines and veils, consent checklist.
- What content should we avoid?
- What should we fade to black?
- How do we communicate discomfort?

3. Character Creation Together (60-90 minutes):
Create characters as group, not in isolation.

Connections: Each character must have:
- Connection to one other PC (established together)
- Reason to care about campaign theme
- Personal goal that can drive adventures

4. Establish Party Dynamic (15 minutes):
- How did you meet?
- Why do you trust each other?
- What's your group's dynamic?
- Do you have a name?

5. Set Logistics (10 minutes):
- Session length and frequency
- What happens if someone misses
- How to handle disagreements
- House rules

### Campaign Journal

Keep Notes On:

Sessions:
- What happened
- Player choices
- Consequences
- Unresolved threads
- Quotes

NPCs:
- Who they met
- Reactions to party
- Goals and secrets
- Status (alive, dead, allied, enemy)

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote Part II: Running the Game}}
\page


Factions:
- Current relationship with party
- Recent actions
- Goals and setbacks

Plot Threads:
- Open questions
- Mysteries
- Future hooks
- Payoff timing

Review Before Each Session: Read last 2-3 sessions of notes.

---

## Tying Player Backstories

### Incorporating Backstories

During Campaign Planning:
Identify 2-3 elements from each character's backstory that can become adventures or plot threads.

Example - Character: Marcus, Ex-Thaldros Soldier
Backstory: Deserted when ordered to kill civilians. Mentor (Commander Vale) helped him escape.

Incorporated:
- Session 8: Commander Vale sends coded message asking for help
- Session 15: Vale captured, faces execution for treason
- Session 22: Vale reveals why he helped Marcus - bigger conspiracy

Distribution:
Each character should have:
- 2-3 backstory adventures (focused on them)
- Regular moments to shine using their skills
- Character development opportunities

### When to Focus on Each Character

Don't:
- Do every character's backstory at once
- Ignore certain characters
- Make backstory adventures feel disconnected from main plot

Do:
- Weave backstory into main campaign
- Give each character spotlight time every 3-4 sessions
- Connect character backstories to campaign themes

---

## Pacing the Campaign

### Session Pacing

Good Variety:
- Combat: 40%
- Social: 30%
- Exploration: 30%

Adjust Based on Table:
If players love combat, increase to 60%. If they prefer roleplay, decrease combat to 20%.

### Arc Pacing

Three-Act Structure for Each Arc:

Act 1 - Setup (2-3 sessions):
- Introduce arc's threat
- Establish stakes
- Give players goal

Act 2 - Development (3-5 sessions):
- Players pursue goal
- Complications arise
- Midpoint twist
- Stakes increase

Act 3 - Resolution (1-2 sessions):
- Final confrontation
- Consequences
- Transition to next arc

### Campaign Pacing

Early Campaign (Levels 1-5):
- Faster leveling (every 2-3 sessions)
- Smaller stakes
- Establish world and NPCs
- Build party dynamic

Mid Campaign (Levels 6-15):
- Moderate leveling (every 3-4 sessions)
- Escalating stakes
- Major plot developments
- Tough choices

Late Campaign (Levels 16-20):
- Slower leveling (every 4-5 sessions)
- World-ending stakes
- Epic encounters
- Building to conclusion

## Ending the Campaign

### Planning the Ending

Start with the End:
When planning campaign, know generally how it could end.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote Part II: Running the Game}}
\page


Example - Primordial Campaign:
Possible Endings:

| Roll | Result |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Reseal all Primordials, save world |
| 2 | Negotiate with Primordials, new world order |
| 3 | Primordials escape, survive apocalypse |
| 4 | Sacrifice to seal prisons permanently |


Don't force one ending. Prepare for 2-3 possibilities based on player choices.

### The Final Arc (Last 5-8 Sessions)

Structure:

Sessions 1-2: Gathering Allies
Call in favors, unite factions, prepare for final battle

Sessions 3-4: Final Preparations
Gather intelligence, craft weapons, final character moments

Session 5: Point of No Return
Launch final offensive, no going back

Sessions 6-7: Climax
Epic confrontation with primary threat, all choices matter

Session 8: Epilogue
Wrap up character arcs, show consequences, establish new normal

### Satisfying Endings

Good endings have:
- Direct result of player choices throughout campaign
- Every character gets moment to shine
- Clear victory or defeat conditions
- Consequences shown
- Emotional payoff
- Hints at characters' futures

Don't:
- Pull victory out of nowhere
- Ignore player choices in final moments
- Kill everyone for shock value
- Leave major threads unresolved
- Rush the ending

### Epilogue Session

After main campaign ends, dedicate one session to:

1. Immediate Aftermath (1 hour):
What happens right after final battle? Celebration? Mourning? Political shifts?

2. Character Fates (1-2 hours):
Go around table. Each player describes what their character does next:
- Do they retire? Continue adventuring?
- What relationships did they form?
- What's their legacy?

3. World State (30 minutes):
Describe how world changed because of party's actions:
- Political landscape
- Faction status
- Major NPCs
- Lasting impacts

4. Campaign Retrospective (30 minutes):
Out of character discussion:
- Favorite moments
- Lessons learned
- Thank yous
- Future plans

## Common Campaign Problems

---

## The Obsidian Spire
Location: Border between Thaldros and Aethoria
Secret Level: Tier 4 (Legend)

Truth: Prison for The Devourer (Primordial of entropy). The spire IS the prison.

Approach: Requires flying or climbing DC 25. Touching spire: DC 20 Wis save or gain temporary madness.

Entry: Invisible door at apex, opens only to those carrying a Primordial artifact.

Interior:
- Single massive chamber
- The Devourer in center (size: gargantuan, appears as living void)
- Seal mechanisms in cardinal directions
- Each mechanism requires legendary artifact to operate

Encounter: The Devourer will bargain—offers incredible power in exchange for weakening just one seal mechanism. Lying. Will consume whoever accepts.

Outcome:
- Reinforce seal: Prevents catastrophe for 1,000 years
- Weaken seal: Devourer escapes in 1d10 years
- Drain power: Gain artifact but weaken seal by 50 years

---

---

---

## The Riftmaw

# Chapter 5: Magic Mechanics Deep Dive: How Magic Really Works in Tirvandor


## Ley Line System

### Basic Mechanics

Proximity Bonus:
- Within 1 mile of ley line: +1 spell attack, +1 spell save DC
- At ley nexus (intersection): +2 bonus
- At corrupted nexus: +3 bonus, but Wild Magic risk

Detecting Ley Lines:
- *Detect magic* shows faint aura in direction of nearest ley line
- Arcana DC 15: Feel ley line within 1 mile
- Arcana DC 20: Determine direction and strength
- Druid/Ranger: Automatic awareness within 1 mile (part of natural world)

### Ley Line Map (DM Reference)

Major Nexuses:

| Roll | Result |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Silverpine Nexus: Beneath university, stable, heavily monitored |
| 2 | Ironhold Deep Forge: Dwarven-controlled, powers magical forges |
| 3 | Kaer Thandros Vault: Secret royal vault, emergency power source |
| 4 | Goldreach Harbor: Underwater, powers lighthouse and wards |
| 5 | The Singing Stones: Druid circle, portal to Feywild |
| 6 | Ashgate Catacombs: Unstable, partially corrupted |
| 7 | Nexus of Seven Sorrows: Fully corrupted, underwater |


Minor Ley Lines: Connect major nexuses. GMs can place 2d4 minor nodes per region as needed for plot.

---

## Spell Creation Rules

### Requirements
- Caster level ≥ spell level ×2
- Access to spell slot of desired level
- Arcana proficiency
- Downtime: 1 week per spell level
- Cost: 50 gp × spell level
- Workspace: Library or laboratory

### Process

1. Research Phase (3 days): Arcana check DC 10 + (spell level × 2)
- Failure: Lose 1 day, retry

2. Creation Phase (Remaining days): Arcana check DC 12 + (spell level × 2)
- Failure by <5: Spell flawed—works but with drawback
- Failure by 5+: Total failure, lose half materials

### Flawed Spells

Roll 1d6 if spell creation failed by <5:

| d20 | Result |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Unstable: Roll d20 when cast. On 1-2, wild magic surge. |
| 2 | Exhausting: Caster gains 1 level exhaustion after casting. |
| 3 | Obvious: Spell creates loud noise or bright flash. |
| 4 | Slow: Requires 1 round longer to cast. |
| 5 | Painful: Deals 1d6 damage per spell level to caster. |
| 6 | Unreliable: 10% chance spell simply fails when cast. |


Flawed spells can be fixed with another week of work and DC 15 Arcana check.

### Example Spells PCs Might Create

Tirvandor's Temporal Refuge (4th level, transmutation)
- Casting Time: 1 action

## Ritual Casting

### Standard Rituals

Any ritual spell can be cast by anyone who:
- Has spell in spellbook/knows it
- Has 10 minutes per spell level
- Uses materials (not consumed)
\column
### Tirvandor Ritual Sites

Consecrated Ground:
- Temple of aligned deity: +2 to ritual spell checks
- Ancient shrine: +1, may have side effects
- Desecrated ground: −2, attracts hostile entities

Ley Nexus Rituals:
- Double ritual spell duration
- Increase spell save DC by +2
- Can affect area 2× normal size

### Custom Rituals (DM Tool)

Requirements:
- Multiple casters (1d4+2 recommended)
- Ritual time: 1 hour per desired spell level equivalent
- Materials: 100 gp × spell level

### Tirvandor Wild Magic Effects (d12)

| d10 | Result |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Ley Feedback: All creatures within 30 ft take 2d10 force damage. DC 15 Dex save for half. |
| 2 | Temporal Hiccup: Time reverses 6 seconds. Everyone except caster remembers. Caster can act differently. |
| 3 | Primordial Whisper: Caster hears ancient language. DC 16 Wis save or gain short-term madness. |

| 11 | Blessing: Spell succeeds, caster gains inspiration. |
| 12 | Stable Flux: No additional effect. Wild Magic suppressed for 1 hour. |


## Artifact Rules

### Attunement

Artifacts require 1d4 days of attunement instead of 1 hour. During this time:
- Caster must spend 4 hours/day meditating with artifact
- Arcana DC 20 to successfully attune
- Failure: Take 4d10 psychic damage, can retry after long rest

### Sentient Artifacts

Tirvandor artifacts are often sentient. When attuning:

Conflict Check:
- If character alignment/goals oppose artifact: DC 18 Cha save
- Failure: Artifact refuses attunement, deals 8d10 psychic damage
- Success: Attunement works, but artifact is uncooperative (DM decides)

Cooperation:
- Aligned character: Artifact grants +2 to all DCs and attack rolls from its powers
- Neutral: Normal functionality
- Opposed: −2 penalty, artifact may betray wielder at dramatic moment

### Example Artifacts

The Sundering Blade (Legendary longsword)
- +3 weapon, 3d8 extra force damage
- Once per day: Cast *disintegrate* (DC 19)
- Sentience: Int 16, Wis 14, Cha 18, LN alignment
- Goal: Prevent second Sundering
- Personality: Stoic, values order and sacrifice

The Forgotten Crown (Legendary artifact)
- Wearer immune to divination
- 3 charges: Erase 1 minute of memory from all who witness an event (DC 20 Wis negates)
- Sentience: Int 20, Wis 8, Cha 12, CN alignment
- Goal: Catalog all forgotten lore
- Flaw: Occasionally erases wielder's memories (DM choice)

---

## Planar Travel

### Permanent Portals

- Singing Stones → Feywild: New moon only, druid key required
- Riftmaw → Elemental Chaos: Always open, extremely dangerous
- Black Archive → Demiplane: Faculty key required, one-way

### Creating Portals

Permanent Portal:
- Requires: 9th level spell slot, ritual at ley nexus, 100,000 gp materials
- Time: 10 days
- Check: Arcana DC 25
- Result: Two-way portal between nexuses

Temporary Portal:
- Use *gate* spell normally
- At ley nexus: Duration doubles, save DC +2

---

## Using Magic Mechanics

For Plot:
- PCs discover corrupted nexus, must cleanse it
- Villain creating artifact, PCs must interrupt ritual
- Ley lines failing, world's magic weakening

For Player Agency:
- Let wizards research spells
- Allow downtime crafting
- Reward creative ritual use

Balance:
- Spell creation is expensive and time-consuming
- Artifact creation is heroic sacrifice
- Wild Magic keeps ley nexuses risky

# Chapter 8: NPC Creation Guide

## Quick NPC Creation

When you need an NPC immediately:

### 1. Name

Use name list or combine syllables:
- Thaldros names: Hard consonants (Karn, Brek, Thorne)
- Aethoria names: Flowing sounds (Lyra, Thael, Rina)
- Iron Guild: Practical (Smith, Iron, Forge) or nicknames (Red, Scar, Quick)

### 2. One Distinctive Feature

Physical trait players will remember:
- "Missing left ear"
- "Voice like gravel"
- "Nervous laugh"
- "Always humming"

### 3. Goal

What do they want right now?
- "Get rid of these adventurers"
- "Make enough coin to eat tonight"
- "Find out who killed their brother"

### 4. Secret

Something they're hiding:
- "Actually works for Iron Guild"
- "Primordial-touched (Stage 1)"
- "Secretly loves the king"
- "Witnessed the murder"

Example:
- Name: Kerra
- Feature: Missing left ear, nervous energy
- Goal: Make enough money to flee to Aethoria
- Secret: Reports to Iron Guild

---

## Full NPC Development

### Personality

Choose 2-3 traits:
- Personality: Brave, cowardly, aggressive, passive, sarcastic, earnest, suspicious, trusting
- Ideal: Freedom, power, justice, family, wealth, knowledge
- Bond: Person/place/thing they care about
- Flaw: Weakness or vice

### Voice and Mannerisms

Make them distinct:
- Speech pattern: Fast/slow, formal/casual, accent
- Quirk: Gesture, nervous habit, catchphrase
- How they address people: "Friend," "Citizen," names vs titles

### Relationships

Connection to:
- Party: Helpful? Hindering? Neutral?
- Factions: Which faction? What rank?
- Other NPCs: Allies, enemies, family

### Secrets and Layers

Three Layers:

| Roll | Result |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Surface: What everyone knows |
| 2 | Hidden: What careful observation reveals |
| 3 | Secret: What only investigation uncovers |


Example: Captain Marcus Vex
- Surface: Loyal Thaldros officer
- Hidden: Questions orders, sympathetic to civilians
- Secret: Passing intelligence to Resistance

---

## NPC Stat Blocks

### Use Existing Stat Blocks

Don't create from scratch. Modify existing:

For Non-Combatants:
- Commoner (CR 0)
- Noble (CR 1/8)

For Skilled NPCs:
- Guard (CR 1/8)
- Scout (CR 1/2)
- Spy (CR 1)
- Priest (CR 2)
- Knight (CR 3)
- Mage (CR 6)
- Assassin (CR 8)

### Modification Template

Base Creature: [Name from MM]
Modifications:
- HP: [Adjust if needed]
- Armor: [Different armor type]
- Weapons: [Change weapons]
- Skills: [Add/remove]
- Abilities: [Add faction-specific]
{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote Part IV: NPCs}}

\page
Example:

Thaldros Elite Guard
*Base: Knight (CR 3)*
Modifications:
- AC 20 (plate + shield with Thaldros crest)
- Weapons: Longsword and javelin
- Add: Pack Tactics (advantage when ally adjacent)
- Add: Disciplined (advantage on saves vs fear)

---

## Villain Design

### Goals and Motivations

Why are they the villain?
- Power: Want to rule
- Revenge: Wronged in the past
- Ideology: Believe they're right
- Survival: Desperate measures
- Corruption: Influenced by Primordial/evil

Good villains believe they're right.

### Methods

How are they achieving their goals?
- Manipulation and lies
- Brute force
- Political maneuvering
- Magic or technology
- Others' suffering

### Weaknesses

How can they be stopped?
- Physical: Vulnerable to specific damage
- Social: Can be turned against allies
- Moral: Won't cross certain lines
- Practical: Limited resources

### Backup Plans

What happens when players disrupt their plans?
- Contingency 1: [Alternative approach]
- Contingency 2: [Escalation]
- Final Gambit: [Desperate measure]

Don't railroad. If players beat villain's plan, villain should adapt or be defeated.

### Example: Captain Helena Vex

Goal: Prevent war between Thaldros and Aethoria
Motivation: Saw too much death, wants peace
Method: Defect to Resistance with military secrets
Weakness: Family still in Thaldros (leverage)
Backup Plans:

| Roll | Result |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | If discovered: Frame someone else |
| 2 | If captured: Fake loyalty, escape later |
| 3 | If desperate: Trade information for family's safety |


## Allies and Mentors

### Helpful NPCs

Quest Givers:
- Clear goals for party
- Appropriate rewards
- Information and resources
- Connections to other NPCs

Mentors:
- Teach skills or knowledge
- Provide guidance
- Challenge party to grow
- May die/retire to force independence

Contacts:
- Provide information
- Sell goods/services
- Connect party to opportunities
- May ask for favors

### Making Allies Interesting

Don't make them perfect:
- Faults and flaws
- Their own agendas
- Limitations and weaknesses
- Can be wrong about things

Give them agency:
- Act when party isn't around
- Have their own goals
- Make decisions that affect party
- Can die or leave

## Rivals and Competitors

Not enemies, but not quite friends:

Types:
- Friendly Rival: Competing for same goals, but mutual respect
- Antagonistic Rival: Actively working against party
- Reluctant Ally: Must work together despite friction

Examples:
- Another adventuring party
- Detective investigating same case
- Noble competing for same position
- Merchant undercutting prices

Benefits of Rivals:
- Create urgency (race to goal)
- Show alternative approaches
- Potential for alliance or betrayal
- Memorable recurring characters

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote Part IV: NPCs}}

\page

## Factions and Organizations

### Faction Members

Low Rank (Guards, Initiates):
- Use basic stat blocks
- Follow orders
- Limited information
- Replaceable

Mid Rank (Officers, Priests):
- Modified stat blocks
- Some autonomy
- Moderate information
- Personalities matter

High Rank (Commanders, Leaders):
- Unique stat blocks
- Major decision makers
- Full information
- Major NPCs

### Faction Loyalty

When do NPCs betray factions?
- Better offer
- Moral conflict
- Corruption or coercion
- Love or friendship
- Threatened family

---

## Using This Chapter

Quick NPC: Name, feature, goal, secret (2 minutes)
Full NPC: Add personality, voice, relationships (10 minutes)
Villain: Goals, methods, weaknesses, backup plans (30 minutes)

Most NPCs need quick creation only. Save full development for recurring characters.

## Encounter Basics

Goals:
- Challenge players appropriately
- Create memorable moments
- Advance story
- Allow player agency
- Provide variety

---

## Combat Encounters

### Calculating Difficulty

XP Budget Method:


| Roll | Result |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Determine Party Level: Average level of all PCs |
| 2 | Count Players: Number of PCs (adjust for NPCs) |
| 3 | Find XP Threshold: |


| Level | Easy | Medium | Hard | Deadly |
|-------|------|--------|------|--------|
| 1 | 25 | 50 | 75 | 100 |
| 2 | 50 | 100 | 150 | 200 |
| 3 | 75 | 150 | 225 | 400 |
| 4 | 125 | 250 | 375 | 500 |
| 5 | 250 | 500 | 750 | 1,100 |
| 6-10 | Multiply by level | x2 | x3 | x4 |
| 11-15 | Multiply by level | x3 | x4.5 | x6 |
| 16-20 | Multiply by level | x4 | x6 | x8 |

4. Select Monsters: Add up monster XP until you reach threshold
Example:
- Party: 4 PCs, level 5

## Using Terrain

Terrain turns simple combat into tactical challenge.

### Terrain Types

Difficult Terrain:
- Rubble, mud, thick vegetation
- Costs 2 feet of movement per 1 foot moved
- Use for 25-50% of battlefield

Cover:
- Half cover: +2 AC, +2 Dex saves
- Three-quarters cover: +5 AC, +5 Dex saves
- Full cover: Can't be targeted
- Place cover strategically for both sides

High Ground:
- Advantage on melee attacks from high ground
- Disadvantage on attacks from low ground
- Changes tactical positioning

Hazards:
- Pits (10-30 feet deep, 1d6/10 feet fall damage)
- Lava/fire (2d10 fire per turn)
- Acid pools (2d6 acid per turn)
- Unstable floors (DC 15 Dex save or fall through)

Interactive Elements:
- Chandeliers to drop (2d10 damage, DC 15 Dex save)
- Pillars to collapse (creates cover or blocks path)
- Levers/switches (activates traps or opens doors)
- Flammable materials (oil, gunpowder)

### Battlefield Zones

Divide battlefield into zones:

Kill Zone: Open area, no cover (dangerous to cross)
Defensive Positions: Cover and high ground
Objective Point: Important location (prisoner, artifact, control point)
Hazard Zone: Environmental danger
Escape Route: Clear path to exit (allows retreat)

## Encounter Pacing

### Combat Length

Ideal combat: 3-5 rounds

Too Short (1-2 rounds):
- No tactical decisions
- Abilities wasted
- Unsatisfying

Too Long (8+ rounds):
- Players bored
- Slog, not challenge
- Resource drain without payoff

Extending Combat:
- Reinforcements arrive (round 3)
- Environment changes
- Boss transforms/powers up
- New objective appears

Ending Combat:
- Enemies retreat (not every fight to death)
- Players achieve objective (don't need to kill everything)
- Environmental change forces end
- Negotiation mid-combat
