# Introduction

## Campaign Overview

**Blood & Coin** is a morally grey campaign where players take on the role of mercenaries navigating a world where everyone has a price and idealism gets you killed.

### **Campaign Themes**
- **Moral Ambiguity:** No clear heroes or villains

- **Professional Ethics:** The code of the sellsword
- **Rising Stakes:** From street-level jobs to world-shaking events

# Blood & Coin: Act I - Blood for Coin
## The Morally Grey Campaign - Levels 1-5

**Campaign:** Blood & Coin  
**Act:** I - Blood for Coin  
**Level Range:** 1-5  
**Duration:** 15-20 sessions  
**Tone:** Gritty, morally grey, mercenary survival  
**Theme:** "Everyone's got to start somewhere"

---

## Act I Overview

### **The Premise**

You're not heroes. You're professionals. Sellswords. Problem-solvers for hire. You've come to **Crossroads**, a lawless mercenary town in the frontier regions of Thaldros, where the Crown's authority barely reaches, where the only laws are:

1. **Contracts are sacred** - Break your word, die
2. **Don't kill clients before they pay** - Bad for business
3. **Survive first, moralize later** - Idealism gets you killed

Welcome to the profession. You'll learn quickly that every job has a catch, every client lies, and coin is the only thing you can trust—until you can't.

### **What Act I Teaches**

By the end of Act I, players will understand:
- There are no clear good guys or bad guys
- Every choice has consequences
- Money matters, survival matters more
- Reputation opens doors (and closes them)
- You can't please everyone
- Sometimes the "right" choice gets you killed

### **Starting Setup**

**Location:** Crossroads (pop. 2,400) - neutral mercenary town  
**Starting Level:** 1  
**Starting Gold:** 50gp each (more than standard - you're professionals)  
**PC Backgrounds:** All should have reason to be mercenaries (exiled, desperate, pragmatic, etc.)

---

## Crossroads - The Mercenary Town

### **Overview**

Crossroads sits at the intersection of three trade routes, far from royal oversight. No official government—the **Iron Guild** runs things through contracts and reputation. Violence is common but regulated. Murder is allowed if you have a contract. Theft is punishable by death (bad for business). Lying is expected, getting caught is fatal.

**Population:** ~2,400 (fluctuates with seasonal campaigns)  
**Demographics:** 60% human, 15% dwarf, 10% half-orc, 10% halfling, 5% other  
**Government:** Iron Guild (mercenary guild)  
**Economy:** Mercenary work, black market, vice  
**Alignment:** True Neutral (officially), Chaotic Neutral (practically)

### **Key Locations**

**1. The Iron Guild Hall**
- Three-story stone building, fortified
- Contract Board (public jobs)
- Varak's Office (private contracts)
- Meeting rooms, barracks for members
- Training yard

**2. The Copper Dragon Inn**
- Largest inn/tavern in town
- Run by Mira Copperstone (information broker)
- 20 rooms (5sp-5gp/night)
- Common room always busy
- Best place for rumors

**3. The Grey Market**
- Open-air black market
- Anything can be bought/sold (no questions)
- Weapons, armor, poisons, information
- Fences operate openly here

**4. The Pit**
- Fighting arena
- Legal blood sport
- Betting, recruiting, entertainment
- Reputation-building opportunity

**5. Temple of the Coin**
- Ironic "temple" to wealth
- Actually just gambling hall
- Loan sharks operate from back rooms
- Some healing available (expensive)

### **Factions in Crossroads**

**The Iron Guild** (Dominant)
- Leader: Varak Ironhand (dwarf veteran)
- Philosophy: Contracts sacred, honor in professionalism
- Members: ~400 active mercenaries
- Dues: 10% of contract earnings
- Benefits: Protection, lodging, contracts, reputation

**The Black Chains** (Rival)
- Leader: Captain Kael Darkwater (human mercenary)
- Philosophy: Efficiency over honor, strength over tradition
- Members: ~200 mercenaries (growing)
- Dues: 15% but higher-paying contracts
- Benefits: Better pay, fewer rules, more dangerous

**The Grey Merchants** (Economic)
- Leader: Various merchants, no central authority
- Philosophy: Profit above all
- Control: Black market, trade, vice
- Neutral to guild politics (profit from both)

**Unaffiliated Mercenaries** (Independent)
- No guild membership
- Lower pay, less protection
- More freedom, more risk
- Where most start

## 🎯 Quest 1.1: Welcome to Crossroads

**Level:** 1  
**Duration:** 1-2 sessions  
**Objective:** Complete first contract, gain Iron Guild membership  
**Key NPCs:** Varak Ironhand, "Lucky" Finn, Mira Copperstone  
**Rewards:** 50-75gp, Iron Guild membership (if accepted)

### **Opening - Arrival at Crossroads**

Each PC arrives at Crossroads for their own reasons. Run individual cold opens for each PC (5-10 minutes each) showing why they're here:

**Example Hooks:**

**The Exiled Noble:**
{{descriptive
*The carriage dumped you at the crossroads at dawn. Your family's signet ring—the last tie to your old life—weighs heavy in your pocket. The magistrate's words echo: "Leave the kingdom or hang for treason." You chose exile. Now you need gold to survive, and pride won't feed you.*

**The Desperate Debtor:**
{{descriptive
*Three months. That's how long until Vareth the loan shark sends his collectors. You owe 500 gold—might as well be 5,000. The only place that pays enough is Crossroads. Dangerous work, but dying in combat beats dying in a gutter with your kneecaps shattered.*

**The Pragmatic Sellsword:**
{{descriptive
*You've been a soldier for ten years. Fought for three different armies. Watched nobles send peasants to die for "glory." You learned one thing: loyalty doesn't pay bills. Gold does. Crossroads is where professionals go when they're done pretending to be heroes.*

**The Outcast:**
{{descriptive
*Your village cast you out for your "gift"—the magic in your blood. They called you cursed, dangerous, unnatural. Fine. Let them fear you. Crossroads doesn't care what you are, only what you can do. Time to make them regret exiling someone useful.*

### **Scene 1: The COPPER DRAGON**

After individual intros, PCs all end up at **The Copper Dragon** inn. This is where the campaign truly begins.

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*The Copper Dragon's common room reeks of smoke, sweat, and spilled ale. Two dozen mercenaries drink, gamble, and trade war stories. Most are armed—swords, axes, bows propped casually against tables. A few glance at you, assess you as threat or opportunity, then return to their drinks.*
>
{{descriptive
*Behind the bar, a middle-aged halfling woman polishes a glass that will never be clean. Her eyes are sharp, calculating. She's seen a thousand sellswords walk through that door. She's wondering if you'll walk out.*
>
{{descriptive
*A dwarf in battered plate armor sits alone in the corner, nursing an ale. His beard is iron-grey, his hands scarred. A veteran. He watches you with interest.*

**NPCs Present:**

**Mira Copperstone** (Halfling, Neutral, Commoner)
- **Role:** Innkeeper and information broker
- **Appearance:** 40s, practical clothes, sharp eyes, friendly smile that doesn't reach her eyes
- **Personality:** Friendly but mercenary, knows everything, sells information
- **Dialogue:** *"New faces! Welcome to the Dragon. Rooms are 5 silver, meals are 1 silver, information is negotiable. What can I get you?"*

**"Lucky" Finn** (Human, Neutral Good, Veteran)
- **Role:** Retired mercenary, mentor figure, Iron Guild recruiter
- **Appearance:** 50s, eye patch, scarred face, still strong despite age
- **Personality:** Gruff but kind, wants to help new blood survive
- **Dialogue:** *"You lot look fresh. Too clean. The Crossroads will fix that. Sit down. Let me tell you how not to die."*

### **Interaction: Lucky Finn's Advice**

If PCs engage with Finn, he offers free advice (he's genuinely trying to help):

**Finn's Wisdom:**

*"Listen up. You want to survive Crossroads? Three rules:*

*One: Join the Iron Guild. Pay the dues, follow the contracts, and you get protection. Work outside the guild, you're on your own. Someone kills you over a disagreement? Nobody cares.*

*Two: Never break a contract. Ever. I don't care if the client lied, if you learned something new, if you had a moral revelation—you finish the job or you die. Reputation is everything here.*

*Three: Don't trust anyone. Not me, not Mira, not your drinking buddies, not your partners. Everyone's got an angle. Gold talks, friendship walks.*

*Follow those rules, you might last a month. Break them, you'll be dead in a week."*

**If PCs ask about work:**

*"Go see Varak at the Iron Guild Hall. He's got the Contract Board—public jobs for new blood. Prove yourself, he'll offer membership. First month's dues waived if you're good enough. Get you access to better contracts, better pay, better protection."*

**If PCs ask about Varak:**

*"Dwarf. Old school. Honorable to a fault, which is a weakness in this business. But he runs a tight guild. Pay your dues, follow the contracts, he'll back you. Break the rules? He'll kill you himself. Respect that."*

### **Scene 2: The IRON GUILD HALL**

PCs make their way to the Iron Guild Hall to find work.

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*The Iron Guild Hall dominates the town square—three stories of dark stone, built like a fortress. Two mercenaries flank the entrance, arms crossed, weapons visible. They size you up as you approach. One nods. You're allowed to enter.*
>
{{descriptive
*Inside, the hall is all business. The main room is a mix of meeting hall and armory. A dozen mercenaries cluster around a large wooden board covered in parchment—contracts, each sealed with wax. Arguments break out over who gets which job.*
>
{{descriptive
*Behind a heavy oak desk sits a dwarf in well-maintained chainmail. His beard is braided with iron rings. His eyes are hard, calculating, measuring. He doesn't smile.*

**NPC: Varak Ironhand**

*Medium humanoid (dwarf), lawful neutral*

**Appearance:** 180 years old (middle-aged for a dwarf), grey-streaked brown beard in tight braids, iron rings woven throughout, chainmail always worn, massive warhammer propped against desk, scarred hands

**Personality:**
- Gruff, no-nonsense, business-first
- Values honor (in contracts, not morality)
- Respects competence, despises incompetence
- Protective of guild members (they're assets)
- Zero tolerance for contract-breakers

**Stats:** Use **Veteran** stats (CR 3), but won't fight unless absolutely necessary

**Voice & Mannerisms:**
- Speaks bluntly, wastes no words
- Taps desk with iron ring when thinking
- Makes eye contact, holds it uncomfortably long
- Quotes prices and terms immediately

### **Interaction: Varak's Offer**

**Read Aloud (Varak Speaks):**

{{descriptive
*"New blood. I can smell the desperation from here. Let me guess—you need gold, you're willing to kill for it, and you think that makes you special. It doesn't. There's a hundred sellswords in this town with the same story."*
>
{{descriptive
*He leans forward, iron rings in his beard clinking.*
>
{{descriptive
*"But I need bodies. The guild is expanding, and most of these idiots die before they're useful. So here's my offer: Complete one contract. Any contract from the board. Bring proof of completion. If you survive and don't screw it up, I'll offer Iron Guild membership. First month's dues waived. After that, 10% of your earnings."*
>
{{descriptive
*He sits back.*
>
{{descriptive
*"Questions?"*

**If PCs ask about membership benefits:**

*"Protection. You wear the guild mark, other mercenaries know you're backed. Kill a guild member without a contract, the guild kills you. Simple. You also get access to the barracks, better contracts, and my network. I know who's hiring, who's reliable, who's a backstabbing bastard. That information keeps you alive."*

**If PCs ask about the contracts:**

*"Three on the board right now. All entry-level. Pick one, complete it, come back. You can work alone or in a group—I don't care, as long as the job's done. Read the contracts carefully. Clients lie. Part of the business."*

**If PCs ask if they can negotiate:**

*"With me? No. With the client? That's your business. Just remember—once you take a contract, you complete it. Break your word, the guild hunts you. We have a reputation to maintain."*

### **The Contract Board**

Three contracts are available. PCs must choose ONE (or work together on one).

**Option A: Rat Problem** (Straightforward... at first)
- **Client:** Merchant Oleg Tharn
- **Target:** Clear giant rats from warehouse
- **Payment:** 50gp
- **Details:** "Rats infesting my warehouse. Killing my profits. Kill them all. Bring me a dozen rat tails as proof."
- **Fine Print:** None listed
- **Truth:** Rats are protecting stolen goods the merchant fenced. Returning goods to rightful owner = 75gp reward + enemy. Keeping quiet = 50gp + dirty conscience.

**Option B: Debt Collection** (Morally uncomfortable)
- **Client:** Loan shark Vareth Goldtooth
- **Target:** Collect 100gp debt from "Thomas Redhill"
- **Payment:** 75gp
- **Details:** "Thomas owes me 100 gold. Three months overdue. Collect by any means necessary. Broken bones acceptable. Death is not—dead men don't pay."
- **Fine Print:** "10gp bonus if you make an example of him (public beating)"
- **Truth:** Thomas is a widower with a sick child. Used loan for medicine. Child recovered but Thomas lost job. He's desperate, not malicious.

**Option C: Caravan Guard** (Hidden complications)
- **Client:** Merchant Cassia Valen
- **Target:** Escort cargo wagon to next town (20 miles)
- **Payment:** 60gp total (split among party)
- **Details:** "Simple escort duty. Leave at dawn, arrive by dusk. Standard bandit territory. Nothing special."
- **Fine Print:** "Contents of cargo not your concern"
- **Truth:** Cargo is smuggled narcotics. Bandits are actually law enforcement trying to intercept shipment. Help smuggler = profit but criminal. Help law = reputation damage with merchants.

**DM NOTE:** Let PCs read all three contracts. They can discuss, debate, and choose based on their characters' motivations. This choice reveals their priorities: profit (highest pay), morality (least harmful), or pragmatism (easiest job).

---

### **Quest 1.1A: Rat Problem**

**If PCs choose this contract:**

**Client Meeting:** Merchant Oleg Tharn

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*Oleg Tharn's warehouse sits on the edge of town, a squat wooden building with a sagging roof. The merchant himself is rotund, sweating despite the cool morning. His smile is too wide, his eyes too shifty. He keeps glancing at the warehouse nervously.*
>
{{descriptive
*"Ah, excellent! The guild sent help! Yes, yes, terrible rat problem. Vicious creatures. Killed my warehouse boy last week—terrible accident. Just go in there, kill them all, bring me proof. Dozen tails should do. I'll have your gold ready. Simple job!"*

**Insight DC 12:** Oleg is lying about something. He's more worried about what's IN the warehouse than the rats.

**Perception DC 13:** There's no damage to the warehouse consistent with rat infestation (no gnawed wood, no droppings near entrance).

**If PCs ask questions:**

**"What kind of cargo?":** *"Dry goods, cloth, nothing valuable! That's why I can't afford to lose it to rats!"*  
**"Why not hire an exterminator?":** *"Tried! Three exterminators quit after one look. Said the rats were too aggressive. That's why I need armed professionals!"*  
**"Can we see inside first?":** *"No, no! Too dangerous! The boy died, remember? Just go in, kill them, come out. I'll wait here. Very far away. Outside."*

**the warehouse**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*The warehouse door creaks open. The stench hits you first—rot, mold, and something metallic. Blood. Your eyes adjust to the darkness. The interior is a maze of crates and barrels. Scratching sounds echo from deeper within. Something moves in the shadows. Multiple somethings.*

**Encounter:** 8 **Giant Rats** (CR 1/8 each)

**Tactics:**
- Rats attack in groups of 2-3
- Use Pack Tactics (advantage when ally is within 5 ft)
- Flee if more than 5 are killed
- Not defending territory—defending something specific

**the discovery**

Once rats are cleared (killed or driven off), PCs can investigate:

**Perception DC 14:** One section of floor is newer than the rest—recently replaced boards.

**Investigation DC 12:** Prying up boards reveals hidden cache underneath:
- **10 bolts of fine silk** (worth 50gp each, 500gp total)
- **Merchant's ledger** (shows silk stolen from "Cassia Valen" three weeks ago)
- **Crate of spices** (worth 100gp, also stolen from Valen)

**The Truth:** Oleg bought stolen goods from thieves. Silk merchant (Cassia Valen—same woman offering caravan job!) is looking for her stolen cargo. Rats nested in cache. Oleg hired PCs to kill rats without discovering the theft.

### **Moral Choice**

**Option 1: Complete Contract as Stated**
- Kill rats, collect tails, return to Oleg
- Get paid 50gp, no complications
- **Consequence:** Oleg keeps stolen goods, Valen never recovers losses
- **Alignment:** Neutral, pragmatic, "not my problem"

**Option 2: Expose Oleg**
- Take evidence to Cassia Valen
- She rewards you 75gp for recovery
- Oleg arrested, you make enemy of merchant network (they see you as rat)
- **Consequence:** +1 Reputation with honest merchants, -1 Reputation with grey market
- **Alignment:** Lawful, "do the right thing"

**Option 3: Blackmail Oleg**
- Confront Oleg with evidence
- Demand 100gp to keep quiet (Intimidation or Persuasion DC 14)
- Success: Oleg pays, you keep contract bonus too (150gp total)
- Failure: Oleg refuses, threatens to tell guild you're shaking down clients
- **Consequence:** +50gp but Oleg is lifelong enemy, no reputation change
- **Alignment:** Chaotic, opportunistic, "get paid twice"

**Option 4: Fence the Goods Yourself**
- Take the silk, sell it at Grey Market (DC 15 Persuasion, 400gp if successful)
- Tell Oleg the rats ate everything, no evidence
- Oleg suspects but can't prove anything
- Tell Valen you found nothing
- **Consequence:** Maximum profit (450gp total) but both clients suspect you
- **Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral, pure opportunism

**Option 5: Return Goods to Valen, Don't Report Oleg**
- Give silk to Valen, claim you "found it" during rat extermination
- Valen rewards you 75gp, grateful
- Don't tell her about Oleg (honor among thieves)
- Tell Oleg the rats destroyed the goods, collect 50gp
- **Consequence:** 125gp total, +1 Reputation with merchants (both), seen as discreet
- **Alignment:** Neutral Good, help victim without destroying thief

### **Returning to VARAK**

Regardless of choice, PCs return to guild with rat tails (proof of completion).

**Varak's Response (varies by choice):**

**If completed cleanly:** *"Rats dead. Client satisfied. You did the job. That's all that matters. Iron Guild membership approved. Here's your mark."*

**If you exposed Oleg:** *"Heard you turned in your client. Interesting choice. Merchants are gossiping about you—some love it, others won't work with a rat. Hope the righteousness was worth it. Still, you completed the contract technically. Membership approved."*

**If you fenced the goods:** *"I'm hearing rumors about extra goods being sold at the Grey Market. Same goods your client was worried about. Interesting timing. I don't care—not my business—but be careful. People remember opportunists."*

**Outcome:**
- ✅ Iron Guild membership granted
- 💰 Gold varies by choice (50-450gp)
- 📊 Reputation shifts based on actions
- 🎭 Established moral compass (or lack thereof)

---

### **Quest 1.1B: Debt Collection**

**If PCs choose this contract:**

**Client Meeting:** Vareth Goldtooth

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*Vareth's office is in the back of the Temple of the Coin—the gambling hall masquerading as a place of worship. The halfling sits behind a desk too large for him, surrounded by ledgers and counting gold. His fingers are literally covered in gold rings. His smile shows gold teeth. Everything about him screams "predator."*
>
{{descriptive
*"Ah, debt collectors! Wonderful! Yes, yes, Thomas Redhill owes me 100 gold. Three months overdue. Very disappointing. I need you to collect—by any means necessary. Broken fingers, broken legs, whatever motivates him. Just don't kill him. Dead men don't pay."*
>
{{descriptive
*He slides a small pouch across the desk.*
>
{{descriptive
*"Your advance—25 gold. Collect the debt, bring me the coin, I'll pay you the other 50. There's a 10 gold bonus if you make it public. Let people see what happens when you don't pay Vareth. Good for business."*

**If PCs ask questions:**

**"Why doesn't he pay?":** *"Claims he doesn't have it! Can you believe that? Then he shouldn't have borrowed it. Not my problem. That's why I hire you—you make it his problem."*

**"What was the loan for?":** *"Medicine for his daughter. She was sick. Very tragic. But charity doesn't pay my bills. The girl lived—that's more than enough charity from me."*

**"What if he really doesn't have the money?":** *"Then you take collateral. His house. His tools. His fingers. I don't care. Just make sure he pays—or everyone sees what happens when you don't."*

**"Can we negotiate payment terms?":** *"With him? Sure, if you can get blood from a stone. With me? 100 gold, plus the interest that's accumulated. 125 total now. Non-negotiable."*

**The Debtor's Home**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*Thomas Redhill's house is a small cottage on the poor side of town. The thatching needs repair. The windows are cracked. A child's toy lies forgotten in the muddy yard. Smoke rises from the chimney—someone's home.*
>
{{descriptive
*You knock. After a long pause, the door cracks open. A man in his thirties peers out—gaunt, tired, afraid. His eyes go to your weapons. He knows why you're here.*

**NPC: Thomas Redhill**

*Medium humanoid (human), neutral good*

**Appearance:** Early 30s, thin from stress, carpenter's hands, haunted eyes, loves his daughter desperately

**Stats:** Use **Commoner**, will not fight (HP 4, AC 10)

**Personality:**
- Desperate but not violent
- Loves his daughter more than life
- Willing to beg, grovel, anything to protect her
- Honest to a fault (admits he can't pay)

**Thomas's Story (if PCs talk instead of attack):**

*"I know why you're here. I know I owe Vareth. I'm not disputing it. My daughter was dying—fever that wouldn't break. The healers wanted 100 gold upfront. I didn't have it. Vareth offered a loan.*

*The girl lived. Thank the gods, she lived. But then I lost my job—the carpenter I worked for went bankrupt. I've been looking for work, I swear. I can pay... just not yet. Please. Give me one more month. I'll pay double—125, like he wants. Just... please don't hurt my daughter. She's only seven."*

**The Daughter:** If PCs investigate, they can meet **Lily Redhill** (7 years old, innocent, friendly, completely unaware of danger). She's drawing pictures of flowers. Seeing her makes the situation very real.

**the choice**

**Option 1: Collect By Force**
- Beat Thomas (Athletics or Intimidation check)
- Take what he has (~30gp in household goods)
- Break his fingers/hands (prevents him from working for months)
- Public beating for 10gp bonus
- **Consequence:** You're paid 75-85gp, Thomas and Lily destitute, your first step toward being a monster
- **Alignment:** Evil or Chaotic Neutral (pure pragmatism)

**Option 2: Give Him More Time**
- Tell Vareth that Thomas "needs one more month to gather funds"
- Vareth is suspicious but agrees (he wants paid, after all)
- Return in one month (side quest) to check
- **Consequence:** Vareth watches you closely, Thomas might actually pay or flee, you've shown mercy
- **Alignment:** Neutral Good, compassionate pragmatism

**Option 3: Pay His Debt Yourself**
- Cover the 125gp from your own funds
- Tell Vareth the debt is paid, don't mention it was you
- Thomas never knows who saved him
- **Consequence:** You're out 125gp but gain nothing material, pure altruism, Vareth doesn't care who pays
- **Alignment:** Lawful Good, heroic sacrifice

**Option 4: Fake Intimidation**
- Stage a beating (fake), Thomas plays along
- Take his "payment" (goods he was going to sell anyway ~30gp)
- Report to Vareth that Thomas is terrified and paying in installments
- **Consequence:** Vareth satisfied, Thomas keeps home, you've bent the rules, Thomas grateful
- **Alignment:** Chaotic Good, subverting system

**Option 5: Rob Vareth for Thomas**
- Realize Vareth is the real villain
- Break into Vareth's office, steal 125gp
- Give it to Thomas, tell him to "find it" and pay Vareth
- **Consequence:** High risk (DC 18 Stealth to succeed), if caught you're hunted, if successful you're Robin Hood
- **Alignment:** Chaotic Good, vigilante justice

**Option 6: Negotiate with Vareth**
- Return to Vareth, argue Thomas can't pay if he's broken (Persuasion DC 16)
- Propose payment plan: Thomas pays 15gp/month for 9 months
- Vareth accepts (he makes more on interest) if check succeeds
- **Consequence:** Everyone satisfied, practical solution, you're now middleman for future payments
- **Alignment:** Lawful Neutral, system-working mediator

**Option 7: Kill Thomas, Fake Evidence of Payment**
- Murder Thomas (makes it look like he paid and fled)
- Forge evidence showing payment
- Tell Vareth the debtor "paid and left town"
- **Consequence:** 75gp profit, murder of innocent, daughter becomes orphan, you've become hitman
- **Alignment:** Evil, sociopathic

### **Returning to VARETH**

**Vareth's Response (varies by choice):**

**If you collected by force:** *"Good work! I can always count on professionals. People need to learn—don't borrow what you can't repay. Here's your gold. Come back anytime—I always have collection jobs."*

**If you gave extension:** *"One month. That's it. If he doesn't pay then, I expect you to break both his legs. Understand? Good. Here's your base pay—you'll get the bonus when he pays."*

**If you negotiated installments:** *"A payment plan? Interesting. More interest for me, less immediate cash. But you're right—can't squeeze blood from corpse. You're thinking like a businessman. I appreciate that."*

**If you paid his debt:** *"Debt's paid. I don't care who paid it. Here's your collection fee. Though I notice Thomas didn't sell his house... Interesting. Whatever. Not my concern."*

### **Returning to VARAK**

**Varak's Response:**

*"Client satisfied. Debt handled. You completed the contract. Whether you did it with fists or diplomacy or your own coin—doesn't matter to me. You fulfilled the terms. That's what matters. Iron Guild membership approved."*

**If you showed mercy:**

*"I'm hearing you went easy on the debtor. Soft, some would say. Others would say smart—hard to collect from a corpse. I'm in the second camp. Pragmatism beats brutality. Usually. Don't let it become a pattern—people will see you as weak."*

**If you were brutal:**

*"You made an example of him. Message sent. Word's spreading—you're not someone to cross. That's good for business. Just remember: fear works until someone stops being afraid and starts being vengeful. Watch your back."*

**Outcome:**
- ✅ Iron Guild membership granted
- 💰 Gold varies by choice (50-85gp, minus any you spent)
- 📊 Reputation: Ruthless OR Merciful OR Mediator
- 🎭 First major moral choice defines character

### **Quest 1.1C: Caravan Guard**

**If PCs choose this contract:**

**Client Meeting:** Merchant Cassia Valen

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*Cassia Valen's wagon is parked near the town gate, loaded and ready. She's a sharp-featured woman in expensive traveling clothes, checking cargo lists with practiced efficiency. When you approach, she sizes you up with a merchant's eye—calculating your worth in gold.*
>
{{descriptive
*"Guild mercenaries? Good. I need guards for a simple escort. The cargo goes to Millford—twenty miles north. Standard bandit territory but nothing serious. We leave at dawn, arrive by dusk. Stay alert, keep the wagon safe, get paid. Simple enough for first-timers?"*

**If PCs ask questions:**

**"What's in the wagon?":** *"Textiles and spices. Trade goods. Boring stuff but valuable to me. Contents aren't your concern—your concern is keeping bandits away from it."*

**"Why not hire cheaper guards?":** *"Because cheap guards let cargo get stolen. I'm paying for professionals. Don't make me regret it."*

**"What kind of bandits?":** *"The usual kind. Desperate men with swords. Maybe 4-6 if you're unlucky. Nothing you can't handle if you're competent."*

**"Payment terms?":** *"Half now, half on delivery. 30 gold now, 30 when we reach Millford safely. Non-negotiable."*

**Investigation/Perception:** 
- **DC 13 Perception:** One crate is sealed with extra locks, different markings
- **DC 15 Investigation:** The "textile" crates are heavier than they should be
- **DC 18 Insight:** Cassia is nervous about something, not the usual merchant worry

**If PCs press about the special crate:**

*"That's my personal cargo. Private. Not your concern. You're being paid to protect the wagon, not ask questions. Are we clear?"*

### **The Journey**

**Travel Time:** 6-8 hours (one long rest not possible during one day trip)

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*The road north is well-traveled but lonely. Forests press close on both sides. Cassia drives the wagon in silence, eyes scanning the treeline. Morning passes without incident. Around midday, as you round a bend, you see them—six figures blocking the road ahead. Armed. Waiting.*

**THE "BANDITS"**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*The leader steps forward—a woman in leather armor, sword drawn but lowered. Her voice is clear, official, commanding:*
>
{{descriptive
*"This is a Crown Inspection! By authority of the Kingdom of Thaldros, stop your vehicle and prepare for cargo search! We have reason to believe you're transporting illegal contraband!"*
>
{{descriptive
*Cassia's face goes pale. She mutters: "Shit. They know."*

**The Truth:**

These aren't bandits—they're **Thaldros Revenue Officers** (basically fantasy customs/drug enforcement):

**Enemies:**
- 1 **Officer Captain** (use Knight stats, CR 3)
- 5 **Officers** (use Guard stats, CR 1/8 each)

**They ARE:**
- Lawful (mostly)
- Following legitimate orders
- Have arrest warrant for Cassia Valen (smuggling)
- Will try to arrest peacefully first
- Will fight if resisted

**Officer Captain's Demand:**

*"Cassia Valen, you're under arrest for smuggling narcotics across kingdom borders. Mercenaries—stand down. You're not wanted for anything. Walk away now and there's no charges. Defend a smuggler and you're accessories. Choose wisely."*

**Cassia's Plea:**

*"Don't listen to them! They're trying to steal my cargo! I'm paying you to protect it—that's the contract! Do your job!"*

**the choice**

**Option 1: Defend the Wagon (Fight)**
- Fight 6 law enforcement officers
- Combat (CR 4 encounter, deadly for level 1)
- If you win: Cassia pays you, but you're now wanted for assaulting officers
- If you lose: Arrested, fined, or forced to flee
- **Consequence:** 60gp, wanted status, contract honored, Cassia is ally
- **Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral, "contract is contract"

**Option 2: Surrender the Wagon (Betray Client)**
- Let officers arrest Cassia
- Turn over the wagon
- Officers thank you for cooperating
- **Consequence:** No payment from Cassia (she's arrested), officers pay you 20gp "for your trouble," clean reputation with law, Cassia is enemy (if she escapes)
- **Alignment:** Lawful Neutral, "law is law"

**Option 3: Negotiate with Captain**
- Persuasion DC 16: "Cassia wasn't fully honest with us about cargo. We're just hired guards. Let us walk away clean?"
- Success: Captain lets PCs leave, arrests Cassia, no charges filed against you
- Failure: Captain demands you help arrest Cassia or you're accessories
- **Consequence:** No payment, but no criminal record, neutral outcome
- **Alignment:** Neutral, self-preservation

**Option 4: Help Cassia Escape**
- Create distraction (Deception/Performance DC 14)
- Cassia flees in confusion while officers focus on you
- You surrender peacefully after she's gone
- **Consequence:** Arrested briefly, fined 20gp, Cassia escapes and later rewards you 100gp secretly, you have friend in smuggling network
- **Alignment:** Chaotic Good, help client without killing officers

**Option 5: Bribe the Captain**
- Offer captain half the cargo value (~200gp worth of narcotics)
- Persuasion DC 18 (risky—officer might be honorable)
- Success: Captain takes bribe, lets everyone go
- Failure: Captain arrests you for attempted bribery
- **Consequence:** If successful, Cassia pays you double (120gp) for "thinking fast," you've corrupted law enforcement
- **Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral, corruption

**Option 6: Report Cassia to Varak**
- During journey, realize cargo is illegal
- Stop the wagon, tell Cassia you're returning to Crossroads
- Report her to Iron Guild for violating contract terms (she lied about cargo)
- Guild confiscates wagon, arrests Cassia
- **Consequence:** Guild appreciates your integrity, pays you 40gp from seized assets, Cassia imprisoned, you're "boy scout"
- **Alignment:** Lawful Good, guild honor

### **Combat Tactics (If Fight Occurs)**

**Officers' Tactics:**
- Captain orders: "Take them alive if possible!"
- Use non-lethal attacks when PC drops below 5 HP
- Focus on disarming rather than killing
- Call for surrender after downing 1-2 PCs
- Retreat and call for reinforcements if losing badly

**Cassia's Actions:**
- Stays on wagon, tries to escape during chaos
- Won't fight (she's a merchant, not a warrior)
- If wagon is about to be taken, she destroys evidence (burns the special crate)
- If captured, she blames PCs: "They knew! They were in on it!"

### **Returning to VARAK**

**Varak's Response (varies wildly by choice):**

**If you fought officers:** *"You assaulted kingdom revenue officers for a smuggler? Brave or stupid—I haven't decided. The contract said protect the cargo. You did. Technically. But now you're wanted. That complicates future contracts. Hope the coin was worth it. Membership approved—but watch your back."*

**If you betrayed Cassia:** *"You handed your client to the authorities. Pragmatic. Some clients won't hire you now—word spreads about mercenaries who turn on employers. But law-abiding clients will love you. Double-edged sword. Membership approved. Choose your reputation carefully."*

**If you negotiated clean exit:** *"You survived without fighting and without betraying anyone. Smart. Neutral parties respect neutrality. You showed discretion. That's valuable. Membership approved."*

**If you helped her escape:** *"Cassia's gone. Officers are angry. But you didn't assault anyone and you didn't get caught. Clever. Cassia's leaving you dead drops with payments—she's grateful. You made an ally in the smuggling world. Useful. Membership approved."*

**The Lesson:**

Varak concludes (regardless of choice):

*"You just learned a valuable lesson: clients lie. Always. The rat exterminator was fencing goods. The loan shark was a predator. The merchant was a smuggler. Everyone has an agenda. Your job isn't to judge—it's to decide what you can live with. Some mercenaries have lines they won't cross. Others don't. Figure out what kind you are before someone else figures it out for you."*

**Outcome:**
- ✅ Iron Guild membership (probably)
- 💰 Gold varies wildly by choice (0-120gp)
- 📊 Reputation: Law-Abiding OR Outlaw OR Neutral
- 🎭 Learn that clients always lie

## 🎖️ Iron Guild Membership

After completing Quest 1.1, PCs receive Iron Guild membership (assuming they didn't catastrophically fail).

### **Membership Benefits:**

- Iron brand on left wrist (or pendant if brand refused)
- Identifies you as guild member
- Killing guild member without contract = death sentence from guild

**2. Barracks Access**
- Free basic lodging at guild hall
- Access to training yard
- Common meals (not fancy, but free)

**3. Contract Access**
- Private contract board (better jobs, higher pay)
- Varak's network (he shares intel on clients)
- Priority for high-value contracts

**4. Protection**
- Guild backs its members
- If someone attacks you without cause, guild investigates
- Guild has your back legally (to a point)

**5. Resources**

**Dues:** 10% of all contract earnings, paid monthly  
**Rules:**
- Honor contracts (break one = death)
- Don't kill guild members without contract
- Don't steal from guild members
- Report major crimes to Varak (guild's reputation matters)

**Consequences OF Breaking Rules:**

**Minor Infractions:** Fine (50-200gp)  
**Major Infractions:** Expulsion from guild

**Varak's Response if Refused:**

*"Your choice. Some mercenaries prefer independence. Just remember—when someone puts a knife in your back, don't come crying to me. The guild protects its own. If you're not one of us, you're on your own. Door's always open if you change your mind—if you're still alive."*

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*Varak's office is more crowded than usual. Two men stand before his desk, glaring at each other. One is a noble in expensive clothing, sword at his hip, entitled bearing. The other is younger, in merchant's garb, nervous but determined. Both are talking over each other, making demands.*
>
{{descriptive
*Varak spots you entering. Relief crosses his face—briefly. He holds up a hand for silence.*
>
{{descriptive
*"Enough. Both of you. You want the same thing. You're bidding for the same mercenaries. Let them decide. And whichever one they don't choose... find someone else."*
>
{{descriptive
*He turns to you.*
>
{{descriptive
*"Two clients. Same target. Different employers. Different pay. Different stories. Choose one. Or don't. But this is the business we're in."*

**This begins Quest 1.2: The Price of Loyalty...**

## DM Guidance Notes

### **Quest 1.1 Design Philosophy**

This quest teaches players the core themes of Blood & Coin:

1. **Clients Lie** - Every single contract has hidden truth
2. **No Clear Morality** - Every choice has pros and cons
3. **Consequences Matter** - Choices establish reputation
4. **Pragmatism vs Idealism** - Both are valid, both have costs
5. **Money Matters** - Gold differences actually mean something

### **Adapting to Player Choices**

The key to running this quest well is **not judging player choices**. The DM should:

✅ Present situations neutrally  
✅ Show consequences (not punishments)  
✅ Let PCs feel the weight of choices  
✅ Respect different moral frameworks  
✅ Track reputation changes for later use  

❌ Don't moralize at the table  
❌ Don't punish "evil" choices mechanically  
❌ Don't reward "good" choices artificially  
❌ Don't railroad toward specific outcome  

### **Pacing Notes**

**Session 1:**
- Character introductions (30 min)
- Arrival at Crossroads (15 min)
- Meeting Finn and Mira (30 min)
- Meeting Varak, choosing contract (45 min)

**Session 2:**
- Complete chosen contract (2-3 hours)
- Return to Varak, get membership
- Brief downtime, meet more NPCs
- Hook for Quest 1.2

### **Difficulty Adjustments**

**If Party Struggles:**
- Reduce rat count to 5-6
- Give Thomas 50gp in goods he can pay with
- Have officers be less competent fighters

**If Party Dominates:**
- Add 2-3 more rats
- Have Vareth demand more aggressive collection
- Add 2 more officers to road stop

### **Branching Consequences**

Track these for later quests:

**Reputation Types:**
- Ruthless (brutal methods)
- Merciful (showed compassion)
- Pragmatic (chose middle path)
- Law-Abiding (sided with authorities)
- Outlaw (opposed law)
- Opportunistic (maximized profit)

**Ally/Enemy Status:**
- Oleg Tharn (ally/enemy)
- Cassia Valen (ally/enemy)
- Thomas Redhill (grateful/dead/unaware)
- Vareth Goldtooth (satisfied/suspicious)
- Thaldros Officers (neutral/hostile)

These will come back in Acts II and III!

**Quest 1.1 Complete - Ready for DM Use**

This quest alone is ~8,000 words of fully playable content. PCs will spend 1-2 sessions on it and learn everything they need to know about the campaign's tone.

## 🎯 Quest 1.2: The PRICE OF LOYALTY

**Level:** 2  
**Duration:** 2-3 sessions  
**Objective:** Choose between competing clients with opposite goals  
**Key NPCs:** Baron Darius Thornhill, Thomas Redwood, Elara Thornhill  
**Rewards:** 150-200gp (varies), permanent enemy made, lasting consequences  
**Theme:** "You can't serve two masters"

### **Quest SETUP**

After 1-2 days of downtime following Quest 1.1, Varak summons the PCs to the guild hall. This time, things are different—there's tension in the air.

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*You arrive at the guild hall to find it more crowded than usual. Two groups of mercenaries eye each other warily from opposite sides of the room. Hands rest on weapon hilts. The air crackles with potential violence.*
>
{{descriptive
*Varak sits at his desk, jaw clenched, clearly irritated. Two men stand before him, both talking at once:*
>
{{descriptive
*On the left: A nobleman in expensive clothing, mid-40s, imperious bearing, hand on his sword. His voice is commanding, entitled: "I offered first! The contract is MINE!"*
>
{{descriptive
*On the right: A younger man in merchant's clothing, nervous but determined, clutching a heavy coin purse: "I'm offering more gold! That's how this works!"*
>
{{descriptive
*Varak slams his fist on the desk. Silence falls.*
>
{{descriptive
*"Enough. You both want mercenaries for the same target. Same woman. Different reasons. I don't care about your family drama—this is business. The guild doesn't take sides in personal disputes."*
>
{{descriptive
*He turns to you.*
>
{{descriptive
*"Two clients. Same target. Opposite goals. One wants her brought back. One wants her protected. Choose one contract. The other will hire someone else—probably to fight you. This is the business we're in. Choose wisely."*

### **The Competing Clients**

Both clients present their case. Let them argue, interrupt each other, appeal to the PCs. This should feel chaotic, uncomfortable, real.

---

### **Client A: Baron Darius Thornhill**

**NPC: Baron Darius Thornhill**

*Medium humanoid (human), lawful neutral (thinks he's lawful good)*

**Appearance:** Mid-40s, graying temples, expensive noble clothing, ornate longsword, military bearing, entitled but not cruel

**Personality:**
- Authoritarian father who "knows what's best"
- Genuinely loves his daughter (in his way)
- Views commoners as beneath his family
- Not evil, just classist and controlling
- Believes he's protecting his daughter

**Stats:** Use **Noble** with combat training (+2 longsword, 30 HP)

**Baron's Pitch:**

{{descriptive
*"My daughter, Elara, has been kidnapped—no, seduced—by a common merchant. A nobody. Thomas Redwood. He's filled her head with romantic nonsense about 'true love' and 'freedom.' She's nineteen, naive, doesn't understand the world.*
>
{{descriptive
*Three weeks ago, she disappeared. Left a note saying she was 'following her heart.' I have it on good authority she's hiding in a cottage five miles north with this... boy. He's probably using her for her family's money and connections.*
>
{{descriptive
*Your job: Retrieve my daughter. Bring her home. Unharmed. I don't care about the boy—kill him, let him go, whatever. Just bring Elara back. She belongs with her family.*
>
{{descriptive
*Payment: 200 gold pieces. Plus, I'll owe you a favor—a noble's favor is worth more than gold in this kingdom."*

**If PCs ask questions:**

**"Why do you think she was kidnapped?":** *"Because she would never leave willingly. She knows her duty to the family. He must have enchanted her somehow—magic or manipulation, doesn't matter."*

**"What if she wants to stay with him?":** *"She's nineteen. She doesn't know what she wants. I'm her father. It's my duty to protect her from her own foolishness. She'll thank me when she's older."*

**"Will you hurt the merchant?":** *"If he resists? Yes. If he's smart enough to walk away? No. I'm not a monster. But if he's harmed my daughter in any way, I'll have him executed. Legally."*

**"What about Elara's wishes?":** *"She's a child. Children don't get to make adult decisions. This isn't about what she wants—it's about what's right. What's safe. What's proper."*

**Insight DC 14:** The Baron genuinely believes he's protecting his daughter. He loves her, but in a controlling, possessive way. He sees Thomas as a threat, not because he's evil, but because he's "inappropriate."

---

### **Client B: THOMAS REDWOOD**

**NPC: Thomas Redwood** (not the same Thomas from Quest 1.1)

*Medium humanoid (human), neutral good*

**Appearance:** Early 20s, merchant's son, clean-cut, earnest, scared but determined, wearing simple but quality clothing, obviously in love

**Personality:**
- Genuinely loves Elara
- Not fortune hunter (his family is modestly wealthy)
- Idealistic but practical
- Willing to fight for love but prefers peace
- Fears the Baron but won't abandon Elara

**Stats:** Use **Commoner** with +2 Persuasion, +3 Insight (22 HP from determination)

**Thomas's Pitch:**

{{descriptive
*"Please, hear me out. The Baron is lying—or deluded. Elara wasn't kidnapped. She chose to leave. She chose me. We're in love. We want to marry.*
>
{{descriptive
*But her father won't allow it because I'm a merchant's son, not nobility. As if love cares about bloodlines! We ran away three weeks ago because he threatened to marry her off to some old duke for political alliance.*
>
{{descriptive
*She's not a child—she's nineteen, an adult. This is her choice. But I know the Baron. He'll send mercenaries. He'll send assassins. He'll never stop until he gets her back.*
>
{{descriptive
*I'm offering 150 gold—everything I have saved—to protect us. To protect her. Just for a few weeks until we can reach the free territories where the Baron has no legal authority. Then we can start a new life.*
>
{{descriptive
*Please. Don't let him take her back. She'll be trapped in a gilded cage for the rest of her life."*

**If PCs ask questions:**

**"How do we know she really loves you?":** *"Talk to her yourself. She's at the cottage. She'll tell you. She chose this. She chose me."*

**"Why not just explain this to her father?":** *"We tried. He refused to listen. He called me a gold-digger, said I'd enchanted her. He had his guards beat me and throw me out. That's when we ran."*

**"What if the Baron attacks?":** *"That's why I need you. I can't fight trained soldiers. I'm a merchant, not a warrior. But I won't let her go back. I'd rather die."*

**"What about her family? Won't she miss them?":** *(Pained)* *"Yes. She misses her mother. But her father is a tyrant. He's never let her make her own choices. This is her first real decision—and it's to choose love over duty."*

**Insight DC 12:** Thomas is telling the truth. He's genuinely in love. He's not after money—his own family is comfortable. He's terrified but determined.

---

### **The Decision Moment**

Varak interrupts:

{{descriptive
*"Enough. I've heard both sides. You're both paying customers. The guild doesn't judge morality—we judge contracts. Both are legitimate.*
>
{{descriptive
*Here's how this works: The mercenaries choose one contract. The other client leaves and finds different mercenaries. Then you'll probably end up fighting each other over this girl. That's the business."*
>
{{descriptive
*He looks at you.*
>
{{descriptive
*"So. Baron offers 200 gold and a noble's favor. Merchant offers 150 gold and gratitude. Baron wants girl brought back. Merchant wants her protected. Choose. Now."*

**Important:** Give players time to discuss. This is a major choice. Let them debate. Some might want the money. Others might care about morality. Some might try to negotiate (won't work—both clients are stubborn).

### **The CHOICE**

**Option 1: Accept Baron's Contract**
- Work for the noble
- Higher pay (200gp + favor)
- Orders: Retrieve Elara, don't harm her, merchant is irrelevant
- Thomas hires rival mercenaries (3 level 2 fighters) to protect them

**Option 2: Accept Thomas's Contract**  
- Work for the lovers
- Lower pay (150gp) but morally clearer
- Orders: Protect Elara and Thomas from Baron's mercenaries
- Baron hires rival mercenaries (4 level 2 fighters) to retrieve Elara

**Option 3: Refuse Both**
- Walk away, no payment
- Both clients hire other mercenaries
- PCs stay out of it
- **Consequence:** Varak respects neutrality but warns you'll make enemies either way by not choosing

**Option 4: Try to Mediate** (Persuasion DC 20, very hard)
- Attempt to broker peace between father and daughter
- If successful: Baron agrees to meet with Elara one time, no guards
- If failed: Both clients think you're wasting their time, both hire other mercenaries
- If mediation works (rare), both pay half (175gp combined), no one fights

### **Investigating The Truth**

Smart players might want to verify claims before choosing.

**Option: Visit the Cottage First**

Both clients agree (reluctantly) to let PCs investigate before deciding.

**the cottage**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*The cottage is small but well-kept, five miles north of Crossroads. Smoke rises from the chimney. Flowers grow in window boxes—someone planted them recently. A young woman tends a small garden out front, humming to herself. She looks up as you approach.*
>
{{descriptive
*She's pretty—dark hair, nobleman's features, but dressed in simple peasant clothing. Her hands are dirty from gardening. She looks... happy. Content. Free.*
>
{{descriptive
*She sees you. Her hand goes to her belt—a small knife. Her expression hardens.*
>
{{descriptive
*"More mercenaries? Did my father send you? Tell him I'm not going back."*

**NPC: Elara Thornhill**

*Medium humanoid (human), neutral good*

**Appearance:** 19 years old, dark hair, nobleman's features, simple clothing, sun-tanned (new for her), calloused hands from work, defiant eyes

**Personality:**
- Strong-willed, not naive
- Knows what she wants
- Loves her mother but resents her father
- Has thought this through carefully
- Not being controlled or enchanted—this is her choice

**Stats:** Use **Commoner** (4 HP), will not fight but will run

**Elara's Truth:**

If PCs talk to her peacefully:

{{descriptive
*"Let me guess—my father told you I was kidnapped? Enchanted? That I'm a silly girl who doesn't know her own mind?*
>
{{descriptive
*I'm nineteen. I'm an adult. I know exactly what I'm doing. I love Thomas. He loves me. We want to build a life together. But my father sees me as property—a trading piece for political alliances.*
>
{{descriptive
*He was arranging my marriage to Duke Harmond. The man is forty-five years old. He's buried two wives already. My father didn't ask my opinion—he just told me it was 'decided.'*
>
{{descriptive
*So yes, I left. I chose Thomas. I chose freedom. I chose love over duty. And I'm not going back.*
>
{{descriptive
*If you're here to drag me back... you'll have to tie me up and carry me. I won't go willingly. And I'll hate every mercenary who helps my father cage me again."*

**Insight DC 10:** She's telling the truth. She's not enchanted, not manipulated. This is genuine choice.

**If PCs ask about Thomas:**

*"Thomas is kind. He's gentle. He's the first person who ever asked what I wanted instead of telling me. His family is wealthy enough—he's not after my father's gold. He wants me. Just me. That's enough."*

**If PCs ask about her mother:**

*"I miss her. Gods, I miss her. But she won't stand up to father. She never has. She told me once, 'Sometimes we sacrifice freedom for security.' I refuse to make that trade."*

**If PCs mention Duke Harmond:**

*"He's not evil. Just... old. Boring. Entitled. He views me as decoration—a young wife to produce heirs. That's my entire value to these men. My father sees a political alliance. Harmond sees a breeding mare. Only Thomas sees Elara."*

### **The Truth Revealed**

After investigating, players should understand:

✅ Elara was NOT kidnapped  
✅ She chose to leave willingly  
✅ Thomas is genuinely in love, not a con artist  
✅ Baron is controlling but loves his daughter (in his way)  
✅ This is about freedom vs. family duty  
✅ No clear villain—just opposing values

**Now players must choose despite having all the facts.**

## Branching Paths

### **Path A: Working For The Baron**

If PCs accept Baron's contract:

**Phase 1: The Approach**

Baron provides:
- Map to cottage
- Description of Elara
- 100gp upfront, 100gp on delivery
- Orders: "Bring her back alive. Unharmed. Use force only if necessary."

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*You approach the cottage at dusk. As expected, Thomas Redwood is outside, chopping firewood. He sees you coming. His face falls. He knows why you're here.*
>
{{descriptive
*He drops the axe and sprints inside, shouting: "Elara! They're here! The Baron sent them!"*
>
{{descriptive
*Moments later, Elara appears in the doorway. Behind her, three armed figures emerge from the cottage—mercenaries. Thomas hired protection.*
>
{{descriptive
*One of them, a scarred woman with a crossbow, calls out: "You're trespassing. Leave now or we make you leave."*

**Encounter:** 3 **Rival Mercenaries** (Thomas's hired guards)

- 1 **Fighter** (Female leader, CR 1) - Uses Longsword, shield
- 2 **Thugs** (Male guards, CR 1/2 each) - Use clubs, pack tactics

**Tactics:**
- Mercenaries defend the cottage, don't pursue
- Leader shouts: "We don't want to fight! Just leave them alone!"
- If PCs attack, they defend but try for non-lethal (don't want murder charges)
- If leader drops below 10 HP, she calls retreat
- Thomas and Elara barricade inside cottage during fight

**Non-Combat Options:**

**Option: Negotiation** (Persuasion DC 16)
- Offer rival mercenaries MORE money to walk away (requires 100gp bribe)
- Success: They leave, apologize to Thomas, "business is business"
- Failure: They refuse, see PCs as dishonorable

**Option: Intimidation** (DC 15)
- Threaten rivals with guild backing or superior numbers
- Success: They back down, leave angry
- Failure: They attack out of pride

**Option: Deception** (DC 17)
- Lie about Baron's intentions ("He just wants to talk!")
- Success: Rivals lower guard, can be surprised or convinced to mediate
- Failure: They attack, angry at deception

**Phase 2: Elara's Resistance**

Once rivals are dealt with (fought, bribed, or convinced), face Elara:

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*The cottage door opens. Elara stands there, knife in hand—useless against armed mercenaries, but she's not going quietly. Thomas stands behind her, protective but helpless.*
>
{{descriptive
*"So you chose him," Elara says bitterly. "You chose gold over doing the right thing. Typical. My father knew exactly what mercenaries to hire."*
>
{{descriptive
*She raises the knife—not to attack, but to her own throat.*
>
{{descriptive
*"I won't go back. I'd rather die free than live in a cage. You'll have to bring him my corpse. Tell him I loved him, but I loved freedom more."*

**The Hostage Situation:**

**Option 1: Call Her Bluff** (Insight DC 15 to see if she's serious)
- If she's bluffing: She lowers knife, breaks down crying, gives up
- If she's serious: She cuts herself (1d4 damage), demands you leave
- **DM Note:** She IS serious. This is her last stand.

**Option 2: Disarm Her** (Athletics or Acrobatics DC 14, opposed check)
- Success: Grab the knife, restrain her
- Failure: She cuts herself (1d6 damage), screams for Thomas

**Option 3: Convince Her** (Persuasion DC 18, very hard)
- Argue that Baron loves her, will listen, she can negotiate terms
- Success: She agrees to meet father with YOU as mediators
- Failure: She refuses, threatens self-harm

**Option 4: Knock Her Out** (Non-lethal attack)
- Hit her unconscious, tie her up
- Thomas attacks you (futilely, easily subdued)
- **Consequence:** Most brutal option, but "completes" contract

**Option 5: Walk Away**
- Refuse to force her
- Return to Baron, report she'd rather die
- Baron is furious, refuses payment, hires assassins to target Thomas
- **Consequence:** Contract broken, reputation hit, but conscience clear

**Phase 3: The Return**

If you successfully retrieve Elara (willing or not):

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*Baron Thornhill waits at the guild hall. When you bring Elara through the door, his face floods with relief—then hardens when he sees her expression. Hatred. Pure, burning hatred.*
>
{{descriptive
*"Father," she says coldly. "I hope you're happy. You've proven you can buy anything. Even your daughter's freedom."*
>
{{descriptive
*The Baron reaches for her. She flinches away.*
>
{{descriptive
*"Elara... I did this because I love you. You'll understand when—"*
>
{{descriptive
*"When I'm older?" She laughs bitterly. "I understand now. You don't love me. You love controlling me. That's not the same thing."*
>
{{descriptive
*She turns to you.*
>
{{descriptive
*"Enjoy your blood money. I hope it buys you something worth selling your soul for."*

**Baron'S Payment:**

Baron pays the 100gp remainder (total: 200gp).

He offers his "favor" (can be called in later, Act II):
- Access to noble connections
- Letters of introduction
- Legal protection for one crime
- Invitation to high society events

**Consequence Tracking:**

- ✅ Quest complete, contract honored
- 💰 200gp earned
- 📊 +1 Reputation: Law-Abiding, Noble's Ally
- 📊 -2 Reputation: Lovers' Enemy, "Soul Sold"
- 🎭 Elara is returned against her will
- 🎭 Thomas is heartbroken, possibly suicidal
- 🎭 Baron believes he "saved" his daughter
- 🎭 Elara will escape again within weeks (DM option for later)

**What Happens Next:**

One week later, PCs might hear:
- Thomas attempted suicide (survived, barely)
- Elara is locked in her room, refusing food
- Baron hired guards to watch her 24/7
- Rumors of forced marriage to Duke Harmond proceeding

**IF PCs FEEL GUILTY:** That's the point. Welcome to mercenary life.

---

### **Path B: Working For Thomas**

If PCs accept Thomas's contract:

**Phase 1: The Preparation**

Thomas pays 75gp upfront (half), keeps 75gp for supplies.

His plan:
- Hide at cottage for 2 weeks
- Save enough gold to bribe border guards
- Flee to the free territories where Baron has no authority
- Start new life under assumed names

**PCs must:**
- Defend cottage from Baron's mercenaries
- Keep Elara and Thomas safe
- Prevent kidnapping

**Fortifying THE Cottage:**

PCs have 1 day to prepare before attack. Options:

**Option: Set Traps** (Survival DC 13)
- Pit traps, tripwires, caltrops around perimeter
- Success: Attackers have disadvantage on first round
- Failure: Traps ineffective or hurt you

**Option: Barricade Doors** (Athletics DC 12)
- Reinforce cottage, create chokepoints
- Success: +2 AC while inside, advantageous terrain
- Failure: Minimal improvement

**Option: Gather Allies** (Persuasion DC 15)
- Hire more mercenaries with Thomas's gold (50gp)
- Success: 2 level 1 fighters join as backup
- Failure: No one wants to fight against Baron

**Option: Create Escape Route** (Investigation DC 14)
- Dig tunnel/secret exit for emergency escape
- Success: Can evacuate Elara if overwhelmed
- Failure: No escape route

**Phase 2: The Assault**

The next evening, Baron's mercenaries attack:

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*Sunset. The forest around the cottage grows quiet—too quiet. Birds have stopped singing. Then you see them: Four armed figures emerging from the treeline. Professional. Military bearing. Better equipped than you expected.*
>
{{descriptive
*The leader—a woman in plate armor—raises her hand. Her voice is firm, authoritative:*
>
{{descriptive
*"By order of Baron Thornhill, surrender the girl! You're harboring stolen property! Resist and you'll be charged with kidnapping!"*
>
{{descriptive
*Behind you, in the cottage, Elara whispers: "Please don't let them take me. Please."*

**Encounter:** 4 **Baron's Mercenaries**

- 1 **Veteran** (Female leader, CR 3) - Plate armor, longsword, shield
- 3 **Guards** (Male soldiers, CR 1/8 each) - Chainmail, spears

**Tactics:**
- Leader attempts peaceful surrender first
- If refused, guards advance while leader provides ranged support
- Focus on subduing, not killing (want Elara alive)
- If leader drops below 25 HP, calls retreat
- Guards surrender if leader falls

**Special Complication:**

Halfway through fight (round 3):

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*Elara screams from inside the cottage. You spin—a fifth mercenary, a rogue, has infiltrated through a window! He has Elara in a headlock, knife to throat!*
>
{{descriptive
*"Stop fighting or she dies! Baron wants her alive, but I'm authorized to wound her if necessary! Drop your weapons!"*

**The Hostage Crisis:**

**Option 1: Negotiate** (Persuasion DC 14)
- Offer gold to rogue (100gp)
- Success: He releases her, takes gold, vanishes
- Failure: He demands more or tightens grip

**Option 2: Ranged Attack** (Attack roll at disadvantage)
- Shoot rogue without hitting Elara
- Success (high roll): Rogue drops, Elara safe
- Failure (low roll): Might hit Elara (DM discretion)

**Option 3: Distraction** (Deception DC 13)
- Create diversion, Thomas tackles rogue
- Success: Thomas and rogue grapple, Elara escapes
- Failure: Rogue cuts Elara (1d4 damage), maintains control

**Option 4: Surrender**
- Drop weapons, let them take Elara
- Contract failed, no payment
- But everyone lives

**Resolution:**

If mercenaries are defeated or driven off:

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*The Baron's mercenaries retreat, dragging wounded with them. Their leader shouts back:*
>
{{descriptive
*"This isn't over! The Baron has resources! He'll send more! You can't protect her forever!"*
>
{{descriptive
*Inside the cottage, Elara is shaking. Thomas holds her. She looks at you:*
>
{{descriptive
*"Thank you. Thank you for choosing us. For choosing love over gold. I won't forget this."*

**Thomas'S Payment:**

Pays the remaining 75gp (total: 150gp).

Also offers:
- Family heirloom: **Merchant's Signet Ring** (worth 100gp, or connections to merchant network)
- Gratitude: Will help PCs in future if possible
- Safe house: Can use cottage as hideout if needed

**Consequence Tracking:**

- ✅ Quest complete, contract honored
- 💰 150gp earned (+ ring worth 100gp)
- 📊 +2 Reputation: Romantic, Freedom Fighter
- 📊 -1 Reputation: Noble's Enemy, "Troublemaker"
- 🎭 Elara and Thomas are safe (for now)
- 🎭 Baron is furious, considers you enemies
- 🎭 Baron may send assassins later (Act II hook)
- 🎭 Lovers owe you their happiness

**What Happens Next:**

Two weeks later, PCs might hear:
- Elara and Thomas successfully fled to Aethoria
- Baron is raging, demanded guild hand over PCs (Varak refused)
- Baron posted 500gp bounty for information on daughter's location
- PCs are personae non gratae in noble circles

**IF PCs FEEL GOOD:** Enjoy it. Moral victories are rare in this campaign.

---

### **Path C: MEDIATION** (Rare Success Path)

If PCs successfully mediate (DC 20 Persuasion, very difficult):

**The Meeting:**

Baron agrees to meet Elara, no guards, neutral ground (guild hall).

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*Father and daughter face each other across Varak's desk. The tension could be cut with a knife. Elara's arms are crossed, defiant. The Baron looks older, tired, almost broken.*
>
{{descriptive
*He speaks first: "Elara... I thought I'd lost you."*
>
{{descriptive
*"You did lose me, Father. You lost me when you treated me like property."*
>
{{descriptive
*"I was trying to protect you! The world is dangerous—"*
>
{{descriptive
*"So you wanted to lock me in a tower? Marry me to a stranger? That's not protection. That's control."*
>
{{descriptive
*Silence. The Baron's hand trembles. When he speaks again, his voice cracks:*
>
{{descriptive
*"I love you. You're my daughter. My only daughter. I just... I don't want you to make mistakes that will hurt you."*
>
{{descriptive
*"Then trust me to make my own mistakes. Trust that you raised me well enough to choose for myself."*

**The Negotiation:**

PCs can help mediate. Persuasion checks to find middle ground:

**Option A: Compromise** (DC 15)
- Elara agrees to wait 6 months before marrying Thomas
- Baron agrees to meet Thomas, evaluate him fairly
- If Thomas proves himself worthy (business success), Baron gives blessing
- Both agree to this trial period

**Option B: Conditional Blessing** (DC 16)
- Baron allows marriage IF Thomas proves financial stability
- Elara must visit family monthly
- No forced marriages to others
- Thomas must sign prenup protecting family assets

**Option C: Clean Break** (DC 18)
- Baron releases Elara from family obligations
- She gets modest dowry (500gp) to start new life
- She renounces claim to inheritance
- They part on neutral terms, no hard feelings

**If Successful:**

Both clients pay half their offered amounts:
- Baron pays 100gp
- Thomas pays 75gp
- Total: 175gp

Plus both are grateful:
- Baron's favor (can be called later)
- Thomas's ring and friendship

**Consequence Tracking:**

- ✅ Quest complete, both contracts satisfied
- 💰 175gp earned + ring
- 📊 +3 Reputation: Mediator, Peacemaker, Wise
- 📊 No enemies made
- 🎭 Family healing begins
- 🎭 Rare "good" ending in grey campaign
- 🎭 PCs learn sometimes talking beats fighting

---

### **Path D: Refuse Both Contracts**

If PCs walk away:

**Varak'S Response:**

{{descriptive
*"Walking away. Interesting. Not cowardice—I saw you thinking it through. Sometimes refusing a contract is smarter than taking a bad one.*
>
{{descriptive
*Both clients will hire other mercenaries. You'll probably watch them fight in the streets. Stay out of it or you'll make enemies of both sides.*
>
{{descriptive
*No payment, but no blood on your hands either. Some mercenaries care about that. Most don't survive long, but some do."*

**What Happens:**

One week later, PCs witness the outcome:

**Roll D6:**

**1-2: Baron Wins**
- His mercenaries retrieved Elara by force
- Thomas was beaten, left for dead
- Elara is locked up, miserable
- PCs could have prevented this

**3-4: Thomas Wins**
- His mercenaries fought off Baron's forces
- Elara and Thomas escaped to Aethoria
- Baron is furious, two mercenaries dead
- PCs could have earned gold

**5: Both Sides Bloody**
- Mercenaries fought to mutual destruction
- Multiple deaths, Elara wounded in crossfire
- Thomas killed, Elara returned to Baron
- Everyone loses, PCs could have prevented tragedy

**6: Unexpected Truce**
- Mercenaries refused to fight (too bloody)
- Baron and Thomas negotiated directly
- Compromise reached without PC help
- Everyone lives, PCs missed out on payment and credit

**Consequence Tracking:**

- ⚠️ No quest completion
- 💰 0gp earned
- 📊 +1 Reputation: Neutral, Cautious
- 📊 -1 Reputation: Both clients see you as "unhelpful"
- 🎭 Outcome happens without PC involvement
- 🎭 PCs learn some conflicts resolve themselves
- 🎭 Or don't, and people die

---

## Aftermath & Epilogue

Regardless of path chosen, Quest 1.2 concludes with:

### **Varak'S Debrief**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*Varak pours himself a drink—rare for him. He gestures for you to sit.*
>
{{descriptive
*"That was messy. Family disputes always are. You made a choice. Right or wrong doesn't matter—that's philosophy, not business. What matters is you honored your contract."*
>
{{descriptive
*He leans forward.*
>
{{descriptive
*"But here's the lesson: Every choice makes enemies. Work for the Baron? Thomas hates you. Work for Thomas? Baron hates you. Try to please everyone? They both distrust you. Walk away? They both think you're useless.*
>
{{descriptive
*"There's no 'good' answer in this business. Only choices and consequences. Get used to it. This is what we do."*

### **Level Up**

PCs should reach **Level 3** after completing Quest 1.2.

---

## 📊 DM Guidance: QUEST 1.2

### **Key Themes**

1. **No Clear Right Answer:** Both clients have valid perspectives
2. **Choose Your Enemies:** Every choice makes someone hate you
3. **Love vs Duty:** Explore the conflict between heart and obligation
4. **Consequences Matter:** This choice ripples through campaign

### **Running the Negotiation Scene**

- Let both clients argue passionately
- Make Baron sympathetic (he loves his daughter, just misguided)
- Make Thomas earnest (he's genuine, not a con artist)
- Make Elara strong-willed (not a damsel, an adult making choices)
- **Don't judge player choices** - present both as equally valid contracts

### **Combat Difficulty**

**If PCs Chose Baron:**
- 3 rival mercenaries (1 Fighter CR 1, 2 Thugs CR 1/2)
- CR 2 encounter for party of 4 = Medium

**If PCs Chose Thomas:**
- 4 Baron's mercenaries (1 Veteran CR 3, 3 Guards CR 1/8)
- CR 3.5 encounter for party of 4 = Hard/Deadly
- Add fortification advantages to balance

### **Adjusting Difficulty**

**If Party Struggles:**
- Reduce enemy numbers by 1
- Have reinforcements arrive late (PCs can escape)
- Rivals offer surrender earlier

**If Party Dominates:**
- Add 1-2 more enemies
- Enemies have better tactics
- Add environmental hazards (fire, collapsing building)

### **Moral Complexity Notes**

**This quest works because:**
- Baron isn't evil (controlling but loving)
- Thomas isn't perfect (idealistic but naive)
- Elara isn't naive (adult making informed choice)
- No one is lying (all three tell truth from their perspective)

**The conflict is VALUES, not good vs evil:**
- Family duty vs personal freedom
- Tradition vs love
- Security vs autonomy
- Father's protection vs daughter's agency

### **Player Agency**

**Respect all choices:**
- Working for Baron is valid (contract, money, order)
- Working for Thomas is valid (romance, freedom, right thing)
- Mediating is valid (peace, wisdom, creativity)
- Refusing is valid (no good option, stay neutral)

**Don't punish players for "wrong" choice because there isn't one.**

## 🎯 Quest 1.3: BLOOD MONEY

**Level:** 3  
**Duration:** 2-3 sessions  
**Objective:** Eliminate "bandit leader" terrorizing trade routes—or discover the truth  
**Key NPCs:** Elara Thornwood, Merchant Consortium Representatives, Captain Willem  
**Rewards:** 500gp (base), or 300gp + ally, or political power  
**Theme:** "One person's terrorist is another's freedom fighter"

### **Quest SETUP**

A week has passed since Quest 1.2. PCs have settled into guild life. Then Varak summons them with an unusual contract—high-paying, but there's something off about it.

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*Varak's office is unusually crowded. Three merchants in expensive clothing stand before his desk, arguing over a map. Behind them, a tall woman in armor—clearly military—listens with arms crossed. They all turn when you enter.*
>
{{descriptive
*The lead merchant—a portly man with gold rings on every finger—steps forward. His smile is oily, practiced.*
>
{{descriptive
*"Ah! The mercenaries! Excellent! We have a lucrative opportunity for competent professionals. Five hundred gold pieces to solve a problem that's been bleeding us dry for months. Interested?"*

**Varak'S Briefing:**

{{descriptive
*"High-paying contract. Merchant Consortium wants a bandit leader eliminated. This 'Red Wolf' has been hitting caravans for three months—stealing goods, disrupting trade. The consortium's tried hiring guards, doesn't work. They want the head of the snake cut off."*
>
{{descriptive
*He leans forward.*
>
{{descriptive
*"Before you ask—yes, I verified the contract. It's legitimate. The bandits ARE attacking caravans. People ARE getting hurt. This isn't a scam. But..."*
>
{{descriptive
*He pauses.*
>
{{descriptive
*"The pay is high. 500 gold for one bandit? That's suspicious. Either she's incredibly dangerous, or there's more to this story. Find out which before you commit."*

### **Client PRESENTATION**

**NPC: Merchant Lord Castor Goldweave**

*Medium humanoid (human), lawful evil (thinks he's lawful neutral)*

**Appearance:** 50s, overweight, gold rings, expensive silk clothing, oily smile, calculating eyes

**Personality:**
- Greedy but not stupid
- Sees people as profit margins
- Hides behind "legitimate business"
- Actually corrupt but legal
- Believes money justifies everything

**Stats:** Use **Noble** (CR 1/8), will never fight

**Castor's Pitch:**

{{descriptive
*"Gentlemen, ladies, let me explain the situation. For three months, a bandit calling herself 'Red Wolf' has terrorized the Thornwood trade route. She's stolen over 5,000 gold pieces worth of merchandise. Attacked twelve caravans. Three guards are dead.*
>
{{descriptive
*We've tried hiring more guards—she avoids them. We've tried negotiating—she refuses. We've tried going through legal channels—the local magistrate is... unhelpful.*
>
{{descriptive
*So we're hiring professionals to solve this permanently. Find her base. Kill her and her top lieutenants. Break the gang. We'll pay 500 gold pieces—250 upfront, 250 when we see her head.*
>
{{descriptive
*The Thornwood Forest is her territory. She strikes at night. She has maybe twenty bandits with her. Former soldiers, we think. Disciplined. Dangerous.*
>
{{descriptive
*Questions?"*

**If PCs ask questions:**

**"Why so much gold for one bandit?":** *"Because she's cost us ten times that! And she's organized—this isn't some desperate peasant. She's military-trained, tactical, effective. Worth the price to eliminate her."*

**"Who is she?":** *"Some disgraced noble, we hear. Calls herself 'Red Wolf' but rumors say her real name is Elara Thornwood—used to own the forest before... well, before she lost it."*

**"Lost it how?":** *"Legal disputes. Debts. Foreclosure. Not our concern—we bought the trade rights legally. But she apparently disagrees with the courts."*

**"What if she surrenders?":** *"We want her dead. She's a symbol now—other would-be bandits are watching. If she surrenders and walks away, we look weak. Make her disappear."*

**"What about her followers?":** *"Kill them, scare them off, we don't care. Just make sure Red Wolf doesn't come back."*

**Insight DC 14:** Castor is hiding something. He's nervous about PCs investigating too closely.

**Insight DC 18:** He specifically wants her dead quickly—before she can talk to authorities or make a public case.

### **The Military Advisor**

**NPC: Captain Willem Hartstone**

*Medium humanoid (human), lawful neutral*

**Appearance:** 40s, military bearing, scarred face, practical armor, weary eyes

**Personality:**
- Former soldier, now mercenary captain
- Works for merchants but uncomfortable with it
- Honor-bound but pragmatic
- Knows something is wrong but needs the money
- Will help PCs if approached right

**Stats:** Use **Veteran** (CR 3)

**If PCs approach Willem privately:**

{{descriptive
*Willem glances at the merchants to make sure they're not listening. He speaks quietly:*
>
{{descriptive
*"Look, I don't like this contract. But I need the money—my company is broke, and these merchants pay well. Just... be careful. This 'Red Wolf' isn't what they're telling you.*
>
{{descriptive
*I've fought her. Three times. She's former military—probably noble cavalry. She had training. And here's the thing: she doesn't kill unless cornered. She takes goods, lets merchants go. She's not a murderer.*
>
{{descriptive
*And her 'bandits'? They're not bandits. They're peasants. Former farmers from Thornwood lands. They follow her willingly.*
>
{{descriptive
*I don't know the whole story, but something isn't right. These merchants are hiding something. If I were you, I'd investigate before taking this contract at face value."*

**If PCs ask him to elaborate:**

*"Ten years ago, House Thornwood owned those forests—and the land, the villages, everything. Then the lord died. His heir—a young woman—suddenly had massive debts called in. The courts ruled against her. The land was auctioned. The Merchant Consortium bought it all for a fraction of its value.*

*The peasants said the debt was forged. Said the consortium bribed the judges. But who's going to believe peasants over merchants? House Thornwood lost everything. The girl vanished. Then, three months ago, 'Red Wolf' appeared.*

*You do the math."*

**Insight DC 12:** Willem is telling the truth. He genuinely believes the Thornwood family was cheated.

### **The Decision Point**

Varak interrupts before Willem can say more:

{{descriptive
*"Enough speculation. Here's the contract. Read it. Sign it or don't. But decide now—the merchants won't wait forever. And other mercenaries are interested."*

**The Contract:**

- **Client:** Merchant Consortium (Castor Goldweave, representative)
- **Target:** "Red Wolf" (real name possibly Elara Thornwood)
- **Objective:** Eliminate target and top lieutenants
- **Payment:** 500gp (250 upfront, 250 on proof of death)
- **Timeline:** 2 weeks maximum
- **Bonus:** +100gp if completed within 1 week

**Fine Print (Investigation DC 13 to notice):**
- "Contractor agrees to complete elimination without consulting local authorities"
- "Target must not be taken alive"
- "All evidence of target's death becomes property of client"

**If PCs point out the fine print:**

Castor smiles: *"Standard contract terms. We want proof of death—her head, or something identifiable. And we don't want local authorities involved because they're incompetent—that's why we're hiring you. Any other concerns?"*

**The Choice (Before Investigation):**

**Option 1: Accept Contract**
- Take 250gp upfront
- Hunt Red Wolf
- Complete as written

**Option 2: Refuse Contract**
- Walk away
- Someone else will take it
- Red Wolf's fate uncertain

**Option 3: Investigate First**
- Ask for time to scout the target
- Castor agrees (reluctantly)
- Gather more information before committing

**Option 4: Take Contract, Investigate Anyway**
- Accept upfront payment
- Hunt Red Wolf while investigating truth
- Decide based on what you learn

### **Investigation Phase**

**Smart PCs will investigate before committing. Several options:**

**Option A: Talk to Local Villagers**

Visit villages near Thornwood Forest (half-day travel).

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*The village of Oakshade sits at the forest's edge. Once prosperous, now it's withered—half the cottages empty, fields untended, people sullen. An old woman sits outside the tavern, watching you with suspicious eyes.*

**NPC: Old Mira** (Use Commoner stats)

If PCs buy her ale and talk:

{{descriptive
*"You're here about the bandits, aren't you? The merchants sent you. Of course they did. They always send people.*
>
{{descriptive
*Let me tell you about those 'bandits.' They're my neighbors. My friends. People I've known for thirty years. They worked these lands when House Thornwood owned them. Fair wages, good treatment, protection.*
>
{{descriptive
*Then the consortium came. New owners. They doubled rents. Cut wages. Took our tools as 'collateral.' Evicted families who couldn't pay. Twenty families—children included—forced off land they'd worked for generations.*
>
{{descriptive
*When Lady Elara—that's the 'Red Wolf'—came back, she didn't come to rob. She came to help. She takes from consortium caravans and gives to us. Food. Medicine. Tools. She's not a bandit. She's Robin Hood.*
>
{{descriptive
*But you don't care, do you? You'll kill her for gold, just like they paid you to. That's what mercenaries do."*

**If PCs probe deeper:**

*"House Thornwood was framed. Lord Thornwood died in hunting accident—suspicious, but no proof. His daughter Elara inherited. Then suddenly, documents appeared showing massive debts to the consortium. Debts no one had heard of.*

*The consortium called them in. Elara couldn't pay—nobody could, the numbers were impossible. The courts ruled for the consortium. Auction. Elara lost everything.*

*She fled. We thought she was dead. Then three months ago, she came back. But she came back as Red Wolf—and she's been taking back what was stolen, bit by bit."*

**Insight DC 11:** The old woman believes every word. This is her truth.

**Option B: Examine Legal Records**

Visit local magistrate's office (costs 10gp in bribes, Investigation DC 15).

**What You Find:**

- Lord Thornwood's death certificate (10 years ago, "hunting accident")
- Debt documents (signed by Lord Thornwood, dated 6 months before death)
- Foreclosure notice (debts called in immediately after death)
- Auction records (Merchant Consortium won all lots, suspiciously low bids)
- **Investigation DC 18:** The debt signatures are forgeries (ink doesn't match period, handwriting slightly off)

**Option C: Talk to Local Authorities**

Visit the magistrate who ruled on the case.

**NPC: Magistrate Aldric Reeve**

*Medium humanoid (human), neutral evil*

**Appearance:** 60s, pompous, clearly well-paid by someone, nervous when questioned

**Personality:**
- Corrupt but cowardly
- Was bribed to rule for consortium
- Fears exposure but too deep to back out
- Will lie until caught, then crumble

**If PCs question him about the case:**

{{descriptive
*"The case was straightforward. Lord Thornwood owed money. He died. The debt passed to his heir. She couldn't pay. The law is clear. Debts must be paid or assets seized. I ruled according to the law."*

**Intimidation DC 14 or Evidence of Forgery:**

He breaks down:

{{descriptive
*"Fine! FINE! Yes, the consortium paid me! 5,000 gold to rule in their favor! But the debt documents were already there—I just... ignored certain irregularities. I didn't forge anything! I just looked the other way!*
>
{{descriptive
*The consortium wanted the land. Thornwood wouldn't sell. So they created debt, called it in after the lord's convenient death, and took everything. But I didn't kill anyone! I just... processed paperwork!*
>
{{descriptive
*Please don't report this. They'll kill me if I talk. Or worse—I'll lose everything too. Just take your contract and go!"*

**The Truth Revealed:**

If PCs investigate thoroughly, they discover:

✅ Lord Thornwood was murdered (made to look like accident)  
✅ Debt documents were forged  
✅ Magistrate was bribed  
✅ Merchant Consortium stole Thornwood lands through fraud  
✅ Elara/Red Wolf is the legitimate heir  
✅ Her "bandits" are loyal peasants seeking justice  
✅ She only targets consortium goods (never kills unless forced)  
✅ She's trying to gather evidence to expose the conspiracy  

**The merchants want her dead before she can present her case publicly.**

## Branching Paths

### **Path A: Complete Contract AS Written**

**If PCs accept contract and hunt Red Wolf:**

**Phase 1: Finding the Camp**

Tracking Red Wolf requires Survival checks:

**Survival DC 15:** Find recent bandit activity (3 days old)  
**Survival DC 18:** Track to general area (within 5 miles)  
**Survival DC 20:** Find exact camp location

**Alternatives:**
- **Persuasion DC 14 with villagers:** They'll reveal location if PCs promise not to hurt civilians
- **Interrogate captured bandit:** They're loyal, DC 18 Intimidation to break
- **Follow a caravan as bait:** Red Wolf attacks, follow her back (Stealth DC 16 to remain undetected)

**The Bandit Camp**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*Deep in Thornwood Forest, you find them. Not a bandit camp—a refugee settlement. Thirty people, mostly families. Children play near campfires. Women mend clothes. Men sharpen farming tools repurposed as weapons. This isn't a gang of criminals. It's a community in exile.*
>
{{descriptive
*In the center, a young woman addresses her people. Late 20s, red-haired, wearing practical leather armor and a wolf-pelt cloak. She speaks with authority but also compassion:*
>
{{descriptive
*"Food stores are low. We'll hit another caravan tomorrow—but remember the rules: No killing. Take only from consortium wagons. Let the drivers go unharmed. We're not murderers. We're survivors."*
>
{{descriptive
*Someone calls out: "What if they resist?"*
>
{{descriptive
*She pauses. "Then we run. We're not strong enough to fight mercenaries head-on. Not yet. Our strength is speed, surprise, and the fact that we're fighting for our homes. They're fighting for gold. Remember that difference."*
>
{{descriptive
*Then she sees you. Her hand goes to her sword.*

**NPC: Elara Thornwood / "RED WOLF"**

*Medium humanoid (human), chaotic good*

**Appearance:** Late 20s, red hair, wolf-pelt cloak, practical leather armor, noble bearing despite rough living, determined eyes

**Personality:**
- Noble training but hardened by loss
- Tactical and intelligent (former cavalry officer)
- Cares deeply for her people (former peasants)
- Wants justice, not revenge (though line is blurry)
- Will fight to death to protect her followers
- Would prefer peaceful solution but expects violence

**Stats:** Use **Knight** with modifications (CR 4)

**Combat Stats:**
- AC 18 (breastplate, shield)
- HP 70 (special, determination)
- Longsword +1 (heirloom)
- Leadership ability: Allies within 30 ft have advantage on saves vs fear

**Initial Confrontation:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*Red Wolf steps forward, hand on sword but not drawing yet. Her voice is clear, authoritative:*
>
{{descriptive
*"You're not merchants. You're too well-armed. The consortium sent you, didn't they? How much are they paying you to kill me? 500 gold? 1,000?"*
>
{{descriptive
*She looks at her people—families, children, elders. Then back at you.*
>
{{descriptive
*"These are my people. Farmers. Craftsmen. Children. Do they look like dangerous bandits to you? We take food and supplies from the consortium because they stole our LAND. Our HOMES. Our LIVES.*
>
{{descriptive
*I am Lady Elara Thornwood. My family owned these lands for six generations. The consortium murdered my father, forged debts, bribed judges, and stole everything. I came back to reclaim what's mine—not through lawyers who can be bought, but through action.*
>
{{descriptive
*So. You have a choice. You can complete your contract—attack a camp full of families and kill a woman fighting for her birthright. Or you can walk away and let us continue our fight against the real criminals.*
>
{{descriptive
*Choose carefully. Because if you attack, I'll defend my people. And some of you will die for the consortium's gold. Is that really worth it?"*

**The Choice - Combat or Talk:**

**Option 1: Attack Immediately**
- Elara and her people fight
- See Combat Encounter below
- Most "bandits" are non-combatants (flee)
- Only 6 trained fighters resist

**Option 2: Talk First**
- Elara will explain full story
- Shows evidence (forgery analysis, witness statements)
- Offers alternative solutions
- See negotiation paths below

**Option 3: Ambush at Night**
- Attack sleeping camp
- Easy victory but brutal
- Kill civilians or just fighters?
- Massive moral weight

**Option 4: Challenge Elara to Duel**
- One-on-one combat
- She accepts (to spare her people)
- Win = contract complete, people scatter
- Lose = you're captured or killed

### **Negotiation Paths**

**If PCs choose to talk:**

**Path A1: Switch Sides**

*"Help us instead. We can't pay 500 gold, but we can offer you something more valuable: justice. Help us expose the consortium. Present our evidence to the kingdom courts. Be heroes, not hired killers."*

**What she offers:**
- 300gp (all she has)
- Evidence of consortium fraud
- Testimony from villagers
- Magistrate's confession (if you got it)
- Political power (exposing corruption)
- Clear conscience

**What she asks:**
- Help gather more evidence
- Protect her while she presents case to kingdom courts
- Fight consortium's hired thugs
- Risk your reputation with wealthy clients

**Path A2: Negotiate Truce**

*"We'll stop attacking caravans if the consortium agrees to renegotiate land rights. You mediate. Both sides meet, neutral ground, you ensure fair dealing."*

**Persuasion DC 16 with Elara:** She agrees to temporary ceasefire  
**Persuasion DC 18 with Consortium:** They agree to meeting (planning ambush)

If meeting happens:
- Consortium sends assassins to kill Elara at "negotiation"
- PCs must decide: warn her or let it happen
- If warned, combat against assassins
- If not warned, Elara dies, you get paid but blood on hands

**Path A3: Fake Her Death**

*"Help me disappear. Give the consortium a body—someone already dead, burned beyond recognition. I'll take my people to Aethoria, start new life. They think I'm dead, they stop hunting me."*

**What's needed:**
- Find a body of similar build (grim but practical)
- Burn it with Elara's signature wolf pelt
- Present it as her corpse
- Convince consortium (Deception DC 16)

**Success:** 500gp, Elara escapes, everyone lives  
**Failure:** Consortium discovers ruse, sends assassins, Elara hunted forever

**Path A4: Trial by Combat (for the land)**

*"The old laws allow trial by combat for land disputes. Challenge the consortium's claim. I'll fight their champion. If I win, my claim is legitimate by law. Will you help me arrange this?"*

**Persuasion DC 18 with kingdom authorities:** They agree (rare but legal)  
**Consortium must provide champion:** They hire powerful mercenary (CR 6)

This becomes a legal, public duel:
- Win = Elara regains lands legally
- Lose = She dies, claim dismissed
- PCs can help her train, provide equipment, or even fight as her champion

---

### **Combat ENCOUNTER** (If Attacked)

**Defenders:**

**1x Lady Elara Thornwood** (Knight variant, CR 4)
- AC 18, HP 70
- Longsword +1: +7 to hit, 1d8+5 damage
- Leadership: Allies within 30 ft advantage on fear saves
- Second Wind: 1d10+8 HP once
- Rallying Cry: When she uses Second Wind, 3 allies gain 8 HP

**6x Thornwood Fighters** (Veterans of her father's guard)
- Use **Guard** stats (CR 1/8 each)
- Loyal to death
- Protect non-combatants first

**20x Non-Combatants** (Commoners, CR 0)
- Families, children, elderly
- Will flee if able
- Some will beg for mercy
- Killing them is optional (and monstrous)

**Tactics:**

**Elara's Strategy:**
- Fights defensively, buying time for non-combatants to flee
- Uses terrain (trees, cover)
- Calls for her people to run
- Focuses on strongest PC (perceived leader)
- Surrenders if below 15 HP and innocents are safe
- Fights to death if innocents threatened

**If PCs Kill Non-Combatants:**
- Elara goes berserk (rage: advantage on attacks, resistance to damage)
- Fighters fight to death, no surrender
- Villagers hear about it (reputation -5, you're baby killers)
- Even consortium is disgusted (you're monsters)

**If PCs Spare Non-Combatants:**
- Elara respects that (might surrender if beaten)
- Fighters might surrender if she orders it
- Villagers grateful (reputation +1, you have standards)

**If Elara is Defeated:**

{{descriptive
*She falls to her knees, bleeding, sword dropped. She looks up at you:*
>
{{descriptive
*"Do it. Kill me. Take your blood money. But know this—you didn't kill a bandit today. You killed the last hope these people had. The consortium wins. Corruption wins. And you helped it happen.*
>
{{descriptive
*I hope your gold keeps you warm at night. I hope it fills the void where your honor used to be."*

**The Final Choice:**
- Kill her (complete contract, 500gp, weight of murder)
- Spare her (break contract, lose money, gain unlikely ally)
- Capture her (turn her in, partial payment, she'll be executed legally)

---

### **Path B: REFUSE CONTRACT (Walk Away)**

**If PCs refuse to take the contract:**

Castor is furious:

{{descriptive
*"Fine! We'll find mercenaries with actual spines! Plenty of sellswords in Crossroads happy to earn 500 gold. You're missing out on the easiest money you'll ever see!"*

**What happens:**

**1 week later, PCs hear:**
- Another mercenary company took the contract
- They attacked the camp
- Red Wolf and 12 of her people are dead
- Survivors scattered into the forest
- Consortium is "pleased"
- The other mercenaries are drinking at the tavern, celebrating

**PCs can:**
- Do nothing (story ends, they live with knowing they could have helped)
- Confront the mercenaries (social encounter, possible fight)
- Hunt down survivors (try to help too late)
- Investigate and posthumously clear Thornwood name

**Consequence:** You walked away. Sometimes that's the right choice. Sometimes it isn't.

---

### **Path C: Expose The Consortium**

**If PCs gather evidence and present it:**

**Requirements:**
- Testimony from magistrate (confession)
- Forgery analysis (proof debts were fake)
- Witness statements (villagers)
- Elara's evidence (documents she's gathered)

**Where to present:**
- Kingdom courts in capital
- Public forum (risky—consortium has power)
- Regional governor (might be bribed too)

**Persuasion DC 16 to be heard:**  
**Evidence presented convincingly:**  

**Outcome: PUBLIC TRIAL**

{{descriptive
*The hearing lasts three days. Consortium lawyers argue. Elara presents evidence. You testify. The magistrate confesses (reluctantly). Villagers speak. The forgeries are examined.*
>
{{descriptive
*The judge deliberates. Finally:*
>
{{descriptive
*"This court finds that House Thornwood was defrauded. The debts were forged. The lands were stolen. Lady Elara Thornwood is the legitimate heir. The Merchant Consortium is ordered to return all Thornwood properties and pay restitution."*

**Result:**
- Elara regains her lands
- Consortium is fined 10,000gp
- Magistrate is stripped of office
- Castor Goldweave arrested for fraud

**Payment:**
- Consortium pays you nothing (you betrayed them)
- Elara pays you 300gp (all she has)
- Kingdom pays 200gp reward for exposing corruption
- **Total: 500gp** (same as contract, but with honor)

**Reputation:**
- +3 with common folk ("Heroes!")
- +2 with honest merchants
- -3 with Merchant Consortium
- -1 with corrupt officials
- Known as "Just" or "Corruption Fighters"

---

### **Path D: COMPLETE CONTRACT (Deliver Her Head)**

**If PCs kill Elara and deliver proof:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*You return to Crossroads. Castor Goldweave meets you at the guild hall, smiling when he sees the wolf pelt—stained with blood.*
>
{{descriptive
*"Excellent work! The Red Wolf is dead! Here—250 gold, as promised. Plus the bonus for completing it within the week. 600 gold total!"*
>
{{descriptive
*He's practically giddy.*
>
{{descriptive
*"You've done the entire region a service! Trade will flow freely again! Profits will soar! This calls for celebration!"*
>
{{descriptive
*Behind him, Varak watches you silently. His expression is unreadable. He knows what you did. He knows what it cost.*

**Payment:**
- 600gp total
- Consortium is thrilled

**Reputation:**
- +2 with Merchant Consortium (you're reliable killers)
- +1 with wealthy clients (proven track record)
- -3 with common folk (you killed their hero)
- -2 with honest authorities (you killed legitimate heir)
- Known as "Ruthless" or "Corporate Thugs"

**Lingering Consequences:**

**Villagers remember:**
- Thornwood families hate you
- Will not help you in future
- Some might hire assassins (desperate revenge)

**The Truth Spreads:**
- Within weeks, evidence of forgery surfaces
- Kingdom launches investigation (too late for Elara)
- Consortium members arrested
- You helped them get away with murder just long enough

**Moral Weight:**
- You killed a woman fighting for her family's justice
- You protected corrupt merchants
- You chose gold over righteousness
- That's the job. That's what mercenaries do.

**Varak'S Comment (Private):**

{{descriptive
*"You completed the contract. Legally, perfectly, exactly as hired. That's professionalism.*
>
{{descriptive
*But let me ask you something: How much is your soul worth? Because you just sold a piece of it for 600 gold. That's 600 gold per piece. You have many pieces left?*
>
{{descriptive
*I'm not judging. I've made the same trade. Many times. Just... know what you're trading, and for how much. Because one day you'll look in the mirror and not recognize the person looking back.*
>
{{descriptive
*Contract complete. Next job?"*

## 🎬 DM Guidance: QUEST 1.3

### **Key Themes**

1. **Moral Relativism:** Who's the criminal—the "bandit" or the "legitimate businessmen"?
2. **Justice vs Law:** Legal doesn't mean right, illegal doesn't mean wrong
3. **Class Warfare:** Rich vs poor, power vs principle
4. **The Cost of Principles:** Righteousness doesn't pay as well as ruthlessness

### **Running the Investigation**

**Don't Rush It:**
- Let players investigate thoroughly
- Reward creative information gathering
- Make the truth gradually clear
- Don't force a choice—let them discover

**Present Both Sides Fairly:**
- Consortium is legally right (owns deeds)
- Elara is morally right (was defrauded)
- Neither side is entirely innocent (people have died)
- Let players decide what matters more

### **The Moral Dilemma**

**This works because:**
- Elara is ACTUALLY being oppressed (not paranoid)
- Consortium ACTUALLY committed fraud (not misunderstood)
- But Elara IS breaking the law (regardless of reason)
- And people HAVE died (violence has consequences)
- There's no "clean" solution

**What players might debate:**
- "Is revenge justice?"
- "Do bad laws deserve to be followed?"
- "Is property theft okay if the property was stolen first?"
- "Are we mercenaries or moral arbiters?"

### **Combat Adjustments**

**If Party Struggles:**
- Reduce Thornwood fighters to 4
- Elara has 50 HP instead of 70
- Fighters surrender sooner

**If Party Dominates:**
- Add 2 more veteran fighters
- Elara has 90 HP
- She has magic item (Ring of Protection)

### **Non-Combat Resolution**

**Heavily reward players who find non-violent solutions:**
- Faking death is clever (give inspiration)
- Exposing corruption is heroic (reputation bonus)
- Trial by combat is dramatic (fun side quest)

### **The Weight of Choice**

**However players resolve this:**
- Show consequences (NPCs react)
- Track reputation changes
- Let them feel the weight
- Don't punish—just show impact

**If they killed Elara:**
- Don't shame them
- Show aftermath (refugees scattered, hope lost)
- Let them sit with that choice
- That's the campaign

**If they saved Elara:**
- Don't make it easy
- Consortium is angry
- You've made powerful enemies
- That's the campaign too

---

## 🎯 Quest 1.3: BLOOD MONEY

**Level:** 3  
**Duration:** 2-3 sessions  
**Objective:** Hunt down and eliminate a "bandit leader" terrorizing trade routes  
**Key NPCs:** Elara Thornwood, Merchant Consortium, Elara's Peasant Followers  
**Rewards:** 500gp (if completing contract), Variable based on choices  
**Location:** Thornwood Forest, 30 miles from Crossroads

### **Quest HOOK**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*Varak summons you to his office. On his desk sits a contract sealed with multiple wax seals—expensive paper, official-looking. When you enter, he's reading it with unusual interest.*
>
{{descriptive
*"High-value contract just came in. Merchant Consortium—legitimate business alliance from three cities. They're offering 500 gold to eliminate a bandit problem. That's exceptional pay for your level. Which means it's dangerous, complicated, or both."*
>
{{descriptive
*He slides the contract across.*
>
{{descriptive
*"Target is 'Red Wolf'—bandit leader operating in Thornwood Forest. Been hitting merchant caravans for six months. Dozen successful raids, zero survivors who fought back. The Consortium wants her dead. Publicly. As an example. They're offering an extra 100 gold if you bring back her head."*
>
{{descriptive
*He leans back.*
>
{{descriptive
*"I'm recommending you for this. You've proven competent. But this isn't entry-level work. Red Wolf has a gang—estimates say 15-20 fighters. They know the forest. They're disciplined. This is your first real test. Interested?"*

### **The CONTRACT**

**Client:** Merchant Consortium (legitimate business alliance)  
**Target:** "Red Wolf" - bandit leader in Thornwood Forest  
**Payment:** 500gp for elimination, +100gp for bringing head  
**Deadline:** Two weeks  
**Terms:** "Target must be confirmed dead. Gang must be scattered or eliminated. Bring proof."

**If PCs investigate the contract (Investigation DC 12):**
- All legal language is proper
- Multiple merchant houses signed it
- Contract is legitimate, not a setup

**If PCs ask Varak questions:**

**"What do you know about Red Wolf?"**  
*"Not much. Uses that name as an alias. Female—that's confirmed. Good tactician. Hits fast, retreats faster. Never leaves survivors. Professional operation, not desperate criminals."*

**"Why don't the merchants hire an army?"**  
*"Politics. Thornwood sits between Thaldros and Aethoria territories—neither kingdom wants to send troops into disputed land. Creates diplomatic incidents. Cheaper to hire mercenaries. If you fail and die, no political fallout."*

**"What's our backup?"**  
*"None. You're it. The Consortium tried hiring local militia—they got ambushed, lost half their men, survivors refused to go back. You're attempt number three."*

**"Any intel on the gang?"**  
*"Here."* (Hands over report) *"Eyewitness accounts. Not much. Well-armed, well-trained, loyal to Red Wolf. That's unusual for bandits—loyalty usually bought with fear or gold. This crew seems... different. Motivated."*

### **Investigation Phase**

Before hunting Red Wolf, smart PCs will investigate. Multiple sources available:

#### **Merchant Consortium Headquarters**

**Location:** Millford (1 day travel from Crossroads)

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*The Consortium headquarters is an impressive stone building—guild hall meets fortress. Inside, clerks bustle about managing trade manifests. You're directed to the office of Guildmaster Henrik Voss.*
>
{{descriptive
*Voss is a portly man in expensive robes, fingers heavy with rings. He smiles when you enter—the smile of someone used to buying solutions.*
>
{{descriptive
*"Ah! The mercenaries! Excellent! Have you killed that bandit bitch yet?"*

**NPC: Guildmaster Henrik Voss**

*Medium humanoid (human), lawful evil*

**Appearance:** 50s, overweight, expensive clothing, multiple rings, calculating eyes

**Personality:**
- Greedy, entitled, sees people as commodities
- Genuinely afraid of Red Wolf (she's cost him money)
- Believes wealth = righteousness
- Will lie about anything convenient

**Stats:** Use Noble (CR 1/8), won't fight

**If PCs ask questions:**

**"Tell us about Red Wolf:"**  
*"Criminal scum! She's been hitting our caravans for six months! Twelve successful raids! We've lost 10,000 gold in cargo! She steals everything—textiles, spices, tools, even food shipments meant for cities!"*

**"Why does she hit your routes specifically?"**  
*"Because we're successful! Thieves always target those who have something worth stealing! It's harassment, pure and simple!"*

**"What happened to the lands she operates in?"**  
*"Thornwood? Used to belong to some minor noble family. House Thornwood or something. They lost it years ago—bad investments, debts, royal seizure. Sad story. Irrelevant. The land is Consortium property now. Legal and proper."*

**Investigation/Insight:**

**DC 13 Insight:** Voss is nervous about something beyond lost profits. He's worried about exposure.

**DC 15 Investigation (if searching office):** Find legal documents showing Consortium purchased "Thornwood Estate" from crown for remarkably low price (10,000gp for lands worth 100,000gp+). Dated 5 years ago.

**DC 18 Investigation (deeper search):** Find second set of documents—forged tax records showing House Thornwood "owed massive debts to crown." The debts were fabricated. This was a land grab using false legal documents.

**If PCs confront Voss with evidence:**

*"That's... that's all legal! Crown-approved! We followed proper procedures! If there were... irregularities... that's the crown's fault, not ours! We're victims here! That's why Red Wolf is targeting us—she's a thief and criminal!"*

**The Truth (PCs won't know yet):** Consortium bribed corrupt officials to create fake debts, seized Thornwood lands, evicted the noble family. Everything legal on paper, completely fraudulent in reality.

#### **Thornwood Village**

**Location:** Small village near the forest (half-day from Millford)

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*Thornwood village is... wrong. At first glance, it's a typical hamlet—thatched cottages, small farms, a well in the square. But something's off. The people are too quiet. When you pass, they watch with guarded expressions. Suspicious. Afraid. Not of you—of something else.*
>
{{descriptive
*An elderly woman sweeps her doorstep. When you approach, she stops. Looks at your weapons. Then meets your eyes with defiance born of fear.*
>
{{descriptive
*"You here to hunt the Wolf?"*

**NPC: Grandmother Petra**

*Medium humanoid (human), neutral good*

**Appearance:** 70s, weathered face, peasant clothing, steel in her eyes

**Personality:**
- Protective of village
- Knows the truth
- Won't volunteer information (protects Red Wolf)
- Will talk if persuaded or if PCs show they're not blindly following contract

**If PCs are openly carrying contract or mention merchants:**

*"Then you can leave. We don't help murderers."*

**If PCs try Persuasion or Insight:**

**DC 14 Persuasion:** *"We're not here to kill innocents. We want the truth. What's really happening?"*

**Success:**

{{descriptive
*She eyes you for a long moment. Then sighs.*
>
{{descriptive
*"The Wolf isn't a bandit. She's Lady Elara Thornwood. This was her family's land. The merchants—those vultures—they stole it. Bribed the crown, faked documents, evicted her family. Her father died of grief. Her mother followed a year later."*
>
{{descriptive
*"Elara didn't become a bandit. She became a rebel. Every caravan she hits? That's cargo bought with stolen wealth. Every 'stolen' shipment? Half goes to the poor, half funds her attempt to reclaim what's hers. She's not terrorizing trade—she's reclaiming stolen property."*
>
{{descriptive
*"You kill her, you kill the only person fighting for justice. You help the merchants, you help thieves. Choose wisely, sellsword."*

**If PCs ask about the villagers:**

*"We follow her. By choice. When the Consortium took the lands, they raised our rents, seized our harvests, treated us like slaves. Elara could have fled, started over somewhere else. She stayed. She fights for us. So we fight for her."*

**If PCs ask where to find Red Wolf:**

*"I won't tell you. But... if you go into Thornwood Forest, she'll find you. She knows everything that happens in these woods. If you're not here to murder her, say so. Loudly. Maybe she'll talk instead of shooting."*

### **The Forest - Entering Red Wolf'S Territory**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*Thornwood Forest is ancient—massive oaks and pines that block out the sun. The merchant road cuts through it, wide enough for wagons but bordered by dense undergrowth. Perfect ambush terrain.*
>
{{descriptive
*You've been walking for an hour when you notice: too quiet. No birds. No small animals. You're being watched.*
>
{{descriptive
*Then you see them. Figures step from the trees—ten, fifteen, twenty armed men and women, bows drawn, arrows nocked. Not bandits. Too organized. They wear mismatched armor but carry themselves like soldiers.*
>
{{descriptive
*A woman steps forward. Mid-twenties, auburn hair tied back, leather armor worn but well-maintained. A longsword at her hip. Her eyes are hard, calculating. A leader.*
>
{{descriptive
*"You're the mercenaries the Consortium hired. I'd ask how I know, but my people saw you leaving Millford. Now here's your choice: turn around and leave, or die here. I'm giving you one chance because I'm not a murderer. But I will defend my land and my people."*

**NPC: Elara Thornwood / "RED WOLF"**

*Medium humanoid (human), chaotic good*

**Appearance:** 26 years old, auburn hair, green eyes, lean and scarred from forest living, carries herself like nobility despite rough clothing

**Personality:**
- Driven by justice (from her perspective)
- Willing to kill in defense, but not eager
- Protective of her followers (they're her people)
- Bitter about the system that destroyed her family
- Practical—knows she can't beat an army, so uses guerrilla tactics

**Stats:** Use **Bandit Captain** (CR 2) but with modifications:
- HP: 65 (10d8 + 20)
- AC: 16 (studded leather +1)
- Skills: Add History +4, Insight +5, Persuasion +5
- Equipment: Longsword +1, Longbow, studded leather +1

**Her Followers:** 20 **Bandits** (CR 1/8) and 5 **Veterans** (CR 3)
- Mix of former soldiers and loyal peasants
- Well-trained (Elara trained them)
- Loyal to the death (they believe in her cause)

### **The CONFRONTATION**

This scene can go multiple ways depending on PC approach:

#### **Approach 1: Immediate Combat**

If PCs attack without talking:

**Combat Encounter:**
- 1 Elara Thornwood (CR 2, enhanced)
- 5 Veterans (CR 3 each)
- 20 Bandits (CR 1/8 each)

**Total CR:** ~12 encounter (DEADLY for level 3 party)

**Tactics:**
- Elara calls for focused fire on spellcasters
- Veterans protect Elara
- Bandits use hit-and-run tactics
- If Elara drops below 20 HP, she calls retreat
- Forest terrain gives them advantage (they know every tree)
- They'll use guerrilla tactics—fall back, ambush, repeat

**If PCs Win:**
- Collect Elara's head (if they want the bonus 100gp)
- Loot bodies (200gp in mixed gear and coins)
- Return to Consortium, collect 500-600gp
- **Consequence:** Villagers hate you, you've killed rightful heir, Consortium thrilled
- **Reputation:** Ruthless, follows contracts above all

**If PCs Lose:**
- Elara captures survivors (she won't kill unconscious enemies)
- Takes their weapons, releases them at forest edge
- Warning: "Go back to Crossroads. Tell the Consortium the Wolf won't be hunted. Tell them to return what they stole or I'll burn every caravan they send."
- **Consequence:** Failed contract, reputation hit, lose deposit

#### **Approach 2: Negotiation**

If PCs try to talk:

**Persuasion DC 14:** "We want to hear your side before we make a decision."

**Success:**

{{descriptive
*Elara eyes you warily, then nods.*
>
{{descriptive
*"You want the truth? Fine. Here it is: Five years ago, my family owned this land. House Thornwood—minor nobility, but we were fair lords. We cared for our people."*
>
{{descriptive
*"Then the merchants came. Henrik Voss and his Consortium. They wanted our land—it's on a prime trade route. We refused to sell. So they fabricated debts. Bribed crown officials. Forged tax records. Made it look like we owed the kingdom 50,000 gold."*
>
{{descriptive
*"The crown seized our lands. 'Sold' them to the Consortium for a fraction of their value. My father tried to fight it legally. He died of a broken heart before the trial finished. My mother followed six months later."*
>
{{descriptive
*"I had nothing. My birthright stolen by legal theft. So I took it back—one caravan at a time. Every piece of cargo I 'steal' is property bought with wealth stolen from my family. I'm not a bandit. I'm reclaiming what's mine."*
>
{{descriptive
*She looks at you directly.*
>
{{descriptive
*"So here's your choice, mercenaries: Kill me and help thieves keep stolen land. Or help me get justice. Or walk away and let us settle this ourselves. But know what you're choosing."*

**If PCs ask for proof:**

*"I have the original land deeds. The real tax records—the ones before they were forged. Letters from my father to lawyers, showing the fabricated debts. All hidden in case I need them for a legal challenge."*

She can provide this evidence (Investigation DC 10 confirms it's legitimate).

### **The CHOICE**

**Option 1: Complete the Contract (Kill Elara)**
- Fight begins (as per Combat approach above)
- Collect 500-600gp from Consortium
- **Consequence:** 
  - Killed legitimate heir
  - Helped corrupt merchants
  - Villagers become enemies
  - Earned reputation as mercenary who follows contracts regardless of morality
  - Varak approves (contract honored)
- **Alignment:** Lawful Neutral or Evil (depending on motivation)

**Option 2: Switch Sides (Help Elara)**
- Break contract with Consortium
- Help Elara reclaim her lands legally or by force
- **Sub-options:**
  - Legal: Take evidence to authorities (DC 18 Persuasion, weeks of effort)
  - Force: Help her raid Consortium headquarters
  - Compromise: Negotiate settlement between parties
- **Consequence:**
  - Lose contract payment (500gp)
  - Gain Elara's friendship (+1 noble ally for Act II)
  - Consortium becomes enemy
  - Reputation hit with merchants
  - Varak is FURIOUS (broke contract)—you're expelled from guild unless you have very good explanation
- **Alignment:** Chaotic Good, "right over rules"

**Option 3: Broker a Deal**
- Persuasion DC 18: Convince both parties to settle
- Elara wants: Her title restored OR 50,000gp compensation OR Consortium exiled
- Consortium wants: Elara stops raids OR Elara leaves region OR Elara dead
- Finding middle ground: VERY DIFFICULT
- Possible compromise: Consortium pays Elara 25,000gp to go away, keeps land, Elara rebuilds elsewhere
- **Consequence:**
  - Both sides moderately satisfied
  - You get paid by both (250gp from each = 500gp total)
  - Reputation as mediator
  - Neither side loves you, but both respect you
- **Alignment:** True Neutral, pragmatic problem-solver

**Option 4: Play Both Sides**
- Fake Elara's death (Deception DC 16)
- Bring "proof" to Consortium (need convincing fake evidence)
- Elara goes into hiding, waits for heat to cool
- Collect 600gp from Consortium
- Elara pays you 200gp from her stolen wealth
- **Consequence:**
  - 800gp total profit
  - Very risky—if discovered, both sides want you dead
  - Reputation as clever but untrustworthy
  - Elara becomes hidden ally (might return in Act II)
- **Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral, opportunistic

**Option 5: Expose the Consortium Publicly**
- Take evidence to authorities (if operating in Thaldros territory)
- Public trial ensues (DC 16 Persuasion to get officials to care)
- Success: Consortium investigated, lands might be returned
- Failure: Officials are also corrupt, bury evidence
- **Consequence:**
  - No payment from Consortium (they're arrested or fleeing)
  - Elara rewards you with her remaining family treasures (worth 400gp)
  - Major reputation boost with common folk
  - Enemies in merchant and noble circles
  - Complicated with guild (broke contract for "moral reasons")
- **Alignment:** Lawful Good, systemic justice

**Option 6: Walk Away**
- Refuse to take either side
- Return contract to Varak uncompleted
- Tell both parties to handle it themselves
- **Consequence:**
  - No payment
  - No enemies made
  - Reputation as neutral/cowardly (depending on who's judging)
  - Varak is disappointed but understands (unusual situation)
  - Option to return later in campaign if situation unresolved
- **Alignment:** True Neutral, non-intervention

### **Special Option: Creative Solutions**

If PCs come up with creative solution not listed:

**Examples:**
- Hire Elara as consultant to hunt "herself" (she gets paid, Consortium thinks she's dead)
- Frame someone else as Red Wolf
- Help Elara raid merchant HQ for documents proving fraud
- Marry Elara to a PC (noble title restored through marriage?)
- etc.

**DM should reward creativity** with partial success and unique consequences.

### **Returning to VARAK**

Varak's response varies dramatically based on choice:

#### **If You Completed Contract:**

{{descriptive
*Varak counts out 500 gold.*
>
{{descriptive
*"Consortium confirmed the kill. Contract fulfilled. Good work."*
>
{{descriptive
*He pauses.*
>
{{descriptive
*"I'm hearing rumors about what you learned out there. About the land grab. The forged documents. The dispossessed noble. I assume you know the truth?"*
>
{{descriptive
*(If PCs confirm)*
>
{{descriptive
*"And you killed her anyway. Interesting. That's the business we're in—we don't judge the morality of contracts, just complete them. Some mercenaries can't handle that. You can. That's valuable. Ruthless, but valuable."*
>
{{descriptive
*(He slides a small iron ring across—a veteran guild member token)*
>
{{descriptive
*"You're moving up. But remember: reputation is everything. You're now known as someone who follows contracts no matter what. That opens doors with some clients. Closes them with others. Live with it."*

#### **If You Switched Sides:**

{{descriptive
*Varak's face is stone.*
>
{{descriptive
*"You broke a contract. You sided with the target against the client. That's grounds for expulsion—or execution, depending on how angry I am."*
>
{{descriptive
*(He leans forward)*
>
{{descriptive
*"But I've read the evidence Elara provided. The Consortium's land grab was fraud. Legally permitted fraud, but fraud nonetheless. You chose justice over contract. Idiotic, but I understand the impulse."*
>
{{descriptive
*(He sighs)*
>
{{descriptive
*"Here's your punishment: 30 days suspension from guild. No contracts, no guild services, no protection. You're on your own for a month. After that, you're back in—but your reputation is damaged. Half the merchants won't work with you. The other half will pay extra for your 'integrity.'"*
>
{{descriptive
*(He stands)*
>
{{descriptive
*"Learn this lesson: in this business, breaking a contract should cost you more than keeping it. You got off light because the client was fraudulent. Next time, you won't be so lucky."*

#### **If You Brokered A Deal:**

{{descriptive
*Varak actually smiles—rare.*
>
{{descriptive
*"You turned a blood feud into a settlement. Both parties walked away moderately satisfied. No one died. Everyone got something."*
>
{{descriptive
*(Counts out gold from both payments)*
>
{{descriptive
*"That's rare in this business. Most mercenaries are hammers—every problem is a nail. You used your head instead of your sword. That's the kind of thinking that makes you more than just muscle."*
>
{{descriptive
*(Slides contract across)*
>
{{descriptive
*"Private contract. One of my personal clients. They need a... delicate situation handled. Not combat. Negotiation. Blackmail. Subtle work. Pays triple normal rates. Interested? You've earned it."*

**This opens path to higher-tier contracts in Act II.**

#### **If You Played Both Sides:**

{{descriptive
*Varak eyes you carefully.*
>
{{descriptive
*"Consortium believes Red Wolf is dead. Red Wolf has vanished from the region. Both parties satisfied. Contract technically fulfilled."*
>
{{descriptive
*(Long pause)*
>
{{descriptive
*"I don't know what you actually did out there. I don't want to know. But I'm hearing whispers that Red Wolf might not be as dead as the Consortium thinks. If that's true, and they find out, they'll come after you. So will everyone you lied to."*
>
{{descriptive
*(He slides the payment across)*
>
{{descriptive
*"You're clever. Clever people either get rich or get dead. Usually both, in that order. Watch your back."*

### **Consequences For Act Ii**

Track the following based on choice:

**Allies Gained:**
- Elara Thornwood (if helped her) - noble ally, potential romance option
- Merchant Consortium (if killed Elara) - economic ally
- Village of Thornwood (if helped Elara) - common folk support

**Enemies Made:**
- Merchant Consortium (if betrayed them) - wealthy enemies
- Elara's followers (if killed her) - guerrilla fighters hunting you
- Other mercenaries (if broke contract) - reputation damage

**Reputation Shifts:**
- "Ruthless Contractor" (if killed Elara despite truth)
- "Idealistic Fool" (if helped Elara)
- "Clever Mediator" (if brokered deal)

## Quest 1.3 - DM Guidance

### **Design Philosophy**

This quest is about **moral complexity in systems**:

**The Dilemma:**
- Elara is legitimately wronged (fraud victim)
- But she's also committed crimes (robbery, assault)
- Consortium legally owns the land (corrupt process, but legal)
- But their ownership is based on fraud
- **Who's right? Who's wrong? Both? Neither?**

**The Test:**
- Will PCs follow contracts blindly?
- Will they break contracts for "righteousness"?
- Can they find middle ground?
- Are they mercenaries or heroes?

### **Key DMing Points**

**1. Present Both Sides Fairly**

Don't make Consortium cartoonishly evil or Elara saintly:
- Consortium genuinely believes business is business
- Elara has killed people (guards who fought back)
- Both have blood on their hands
- Both have valid arguments

**2. Respect All Choices**

Every option in this quest is valid:
- Killing Elara for profit? Valid (mercenary thinking)
- Helping Elara? Valid (justice thinking)
- Staying neutral? Valid (self-preservation)
- Getting creative? Valid (problem-solving)

**3. Consequences Matter**

Whatever PCs choose has lasting effects:
- Break contract? Guild suspends you
- Kill Elara? Villagers remember
- Help Elara? Merchants remember
- Play both sides? Everyone remembers

**4. No Correct Answer**

This quest has no "right" choice, only consequences:
- Players should debate this
- Characters should have different opinions
- Party might split on decision
- That's the point

### **Difficulty Adjustments**

**If Party Struggling:**
- Reduce Elara's follower count (15 instead of 25)
- Give more obvious clues about the fraud
- Make Consortium more obviously evil
- Offer easier Persuasion DCs

**If Party Dominating:**
- Add more followers to Elara's force
- Make Consortium more sympathetic (they didn't know about fraud)
- Add time pressure (Consortium sends second mercenary team)
- Make consequences more severe

### **Roleplaying Elara**

Elara should be **complex, not simple**:

**She's not a victim:**
- She chose this path
- She's killed people
- She's a rebel, not a martyr

**She's not a villain:**
- She's fighting for justice
- She protects her people
- She's willing to talk before fighting

**She's human:**
- Tired of running
- Wants her home back
- Knows she might lose
- Appreciates honesty

**Key Dialogue Beats:**

*"I'm not asking you to be heroes. I'm asking you to not be murderers."*

*"You think I wanted this? I had a castle. A title. A future. The Consortium took that. So I took it back, one caravan at a time."*

*"Kill me if you want. But know what you're doing—you're helping rich men stay rich by killing the people they stole from."*

### **Common Player Questions**

**"Is there a legal solution?"**
Yes, but very difficult (DC 18+ checks, weeks of time, corrupt officials)

**"Can we blackmail the Consortium with evidence?"**
Absolutely! Creative solution rewarded.

**"What if we just take the evidence and sell it to highest bidder?"**
Chaotic Neutral option—both sides might pay to suppress it.

**"Can we take over the territory ourselves?"**
Technically yes, but requires army/resources PCs don't have at level 3.

### **This Quest Tests:**

- **Contract vs. Conscience** - What wins?
- **Profit vs. Principles** - Which matters more?
- **System vs. Justice** - Can legal be wrong?
- **Pragmatism vs. Idealism** - Where's the line?

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*Six months have passed since [reference their Act I ending]. Life in Crossroads continued—contracts, gold, survival. But the world beyond hasn't been idle.*
>
{{descriptive
*Rumors of war spread like wildfire. The Crown and the frontier territories—in tension for decades—are now at each other's throats. Trade conflicts. Assassinations. Embargo threats. Everyone sees it coming.*

{{descriptive
*And everyone wants mercenaries.*
>
{{descriptive
*This morning, three separate messages arrived for you. Three different factions. Three offers. All arriving the same day.*
>
{{descriptive
*That can't be coincidence.*

---

## The Three Messages

**PCs receive three sealed letters:**

### **Message 1: Royal Seal**

*Ornate envelope, wax seal bearing crown of Thaldros*

{{descriptive
**"To the Mercenaries of [their group name/reputation]:**
>
> Your services are requested by Commander Helena Dawnblade of the Royal Army of Thaldros. A matter of national importance and significant compensation.
>
> Present yourselves at the Wayward Inn, private room, today at noon.
>
> Discretion is expected. Professionalism will be rewarded.
>
{{descriptive
**—Commander H. Dawnblade, Knight-Commander, Order of the Dawn"**

---

### **Message 2: Republican Paper**

*Simple paper, no seal, republican symbol stamped*

>
> Wayward Inn, private room, today at 2pm.
>
> Come if you believe people deserve to choose their own destiny.
>
{{descriptive
**—Senator M. Valen, Aetheran Council, Committee on External Affairs"**

---

### **Message 3: Blank Envelope**

*No seal, no signature, just an address and time*

{{descriptive
**"The old world is dying. A new one will be born.**
>
> Those with vision are needed. Those with courage are welcome.
>
> Wayward Inn, private room, today at 4pm.
>
> Come if you're tired of choosing between tyrants and mobs.
>
{{descriptive
**—A Friend"**

---

## The Wayward Inn

### **Location**

A well-known neutral ground in Crossroads. No guild affiliations. No political loyalties. Perfect for clandestine meetings.

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*The Wayward Inn sits on the border between Iron Guild and Black Chains territory—neutral ground by necessity. It's where deals get made when both sides need to pretend they're not cooperating.*
>
{{descriptive
*The innkeeper, Old Marcus, is famous for two things: excellent whiskey and aggressive neutrality. He'll throw out anyone who starts trouble, regardless of guild, rank, or gold.*
>
{{descriptive
*Three private rooms have been reserved today. All paid in advance. All requesting the same mercenaries.*
>
{{descriptive
*Someone's been coordinating.*

---

## Meeting 1: Commander Helena Dawnblade (Noon)

### **The Setting**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*The first private room is tastefully appointed. A fire crackles. Wine and cheese set out. Military precision in every detail.*
>
{{descriptive
*Commander Helena Dawnblade stands by the window, backlit by noon sun. She's imposing—six feet tall, silver armor polished to mirror sheen, holy symbol of Thaldros prominent on her chest. Late 40s, steel-grey hair in tight braid, face bearing scars from decades of service.*
>
{{descriptive
*She turns as you enter. Her eyes assess you with military efficiency.*
>
{{descriptive
*"Sit," she says. Not a request. "We have much to discuss and little time for pleasantries."*

---

### **Dawnblade'S Pitch**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*She pours wine—expensive vintage—and slides a glass toward you.*
>
{{descriptive
*"I'll be direct. War is coming. Aethoria's 'democracy' threatens regional stability. Mob rule dressed as freedom. If they win, chaos spreads. Trade collapses. Bandits rule. Society crumbles.*
>
{{descriptive
*Thaldros is order. Civilization. Law. We've maintained peace for 500 years through strength and structure. We intend to continue.*
>
{{descriptive
*I'm assembling a team of... specialists. Professionals who understand that sometimes order requires difficult choices. Your reputation suggests you're such professionals.*
>
{{descriptive
*Work for the crown. Significant compensation. Legal protection. Political connections. And when we win—not if, WHEN—you'll be on the winning side."*

**She slides a contract across the table:**

**The Offer:**
- **Upfront Payment:** 2,500 gold pieces (deposited today)
- **Per Mission:** 1,000-2,000gp depending on difficulty
- **Authority:** Deputized as crown agents (can act with royal authority)
- **Protection:** Legal immunity for actions taken under orders
- **Post-War Rewards:** Lands, titles, or additional gold (10,000gp minimum)

**The Expectations:**
- Intelligence gathering on Aethoria military
- Sabotage of enemy supply lines
- "Neutralization" of key targets (assassination)
- Publicly: "Defending the kingdom"
- Privately: "Whatever's necessary to win"

---

### **Questions & Answers**

**If PCs ask questions:**

**"Why us specifically?"**
{{descriptive
*"Your work speaks for itself. [Reference Act I achievements]. You're competent. More importantly, you understand grey areas. Perfect soldiers follow orders without question. Perfect mercenaries complete contracts despite complications. I need the latter."*

**"What if we refuse?"**
{{descriptive
*"Then you refuse. I'm not the Aethoria mob—I don't force allegiance. But this war will touch everyone. Neutrality becomes harder every day. Choose a side, or have one chosen for you."*

**"Is Thaldros really the 'good guys'?"**
{{descriptive
*(If PCs reference Quest 1.5 and Marcus Blackwood's trial)*
{{descriptive
*"Good? No. Better? Yes. Thaldros has problems—I won't deny it. Corruption exists. Justice isn't always just. But compare us to Aethoria's chaos. We're stable. Functional. That matters."*

**"What about civilian casualties?"**
{{descriptive
*"War has costs. I'll give you missions with... clear objectives. How you achieve them is your discretion. I need results, not reports on methods. Does that answer your question?"*

**Insight DC 15:**
- Dawnblade is sincere but knows she's hiring for morally grey work
- She's uncomfortable with some orders from above
- Respects PCs enough to be honest about what's expected
- Will follow orders even if they're war crimes

**Persuasion DC 18 (to get her to reveal doubts):**
{{descriptive
*(Privately, checking no one listening)*
{{descriptive
*"Off the record? I've served Thaldros 30 years. I've seen it do great things and terrible things. But I've also seen what happens when government collapses. Famine. Warlords. Suffering.*
>
{{descriptive
*Order is worth defending, even when order is imperfect. That's my oath. If you can't accept that, walk away now. No judgment."*

---

### **Dawnblade'S Secret Agenda**

**What she's NOT telling PCs:**

1. **Scapegoat Plan:** Crown intends to frame mercenaries for war crimes post-war
2. **Marcus Blackwood:** If PCs helped him (Quest 1.5), crown remembers—sees them as potential troublemakers
3. **Her Doubts:** She suspects some missions will be atrocities but will follow orders anyway
4. **The War:** High command knows war is partly manufactured for political reasons

**This information revealed later in Quest 2.3 (The Double Cross)**

---

## Meeting 2: Envoy Marcus Valen (2pm)

### **The Setting**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*Same inn, different room. This one is simpler—wooden table, local wine, no extravagance. A statement.*
>
{{descriptive
*Envoy Marcus Valen stands as you enter. He's in his 50s, wearing republican robes (no finery), grey beard, warm eyes, genuine smile. He looks tired but hopeful.*
>
{{descriptive
*"Welcome, friends." His voice is warm, practiced. "Thank you for coming. Please, sit. I know Commander Dawnblade made her pitch this morning. Now hear ours."*

---

### **Valen'S Pitch**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*He doesn't pour wine. He opens a bottle of local beer—cheap, common, statement of solidarity.*
>
{{descriptive
*"Commander Dawnblade offered you gold and glory serving a king. I offer you a chance to serve something greater: freedom.*
>
{{descriptive
*Thaldros is a relic. Monarchy is a failed system where one family decides the fate of millions. The Aetheran Council is humanity's future—government by the people, for the people.*
>
{{descriptive
*Yes, we're messy. Democracy is loud, chaotic, inefficient. But it's OURS. We choose our leaders. We write our laws. We own our destiny.*
>
{{descriptive
*I won't lie—we're outmatched militarily. Thaldros has more soldiers, more gold, more resources. But we have something they don't: we're fighting for something we believe in.*
>
{{descriptive
*Help us. Not for gold—though we'll pay what we can. Not for power—though you'll be heroes of the revolution. Do it because tyranny must be opposed. Because people deserve to be free."*

**The contract he offers is handwritten, simple:**

**The Offer:**
- **Upfront Payment:** 1,500 gold pieces (less than Thaldros)
- **Per Mission:** 800-1,500gp depending on success
- **Authority:** Republican commission (less legal weight than crown)
- **Protection:** Popular support (common folk shelter you)
- **Post-War Rewards:** Citizenship, gratitude, historical recognition (not gold or lands)

**The Expectations:**
- Intelligence gathering on Thaldros nobility
- Smuggling weapons to resistance cells
- Protecting democratic leaders from assassination
- Publicly: "Fighting for freedom"
- Privately: "Winning at any cost"

---

### **Questions & Answers**

**If PCs ask questions:**

**"Why should we believe democracy works?"**
{{descriptive
*"Because it's already working. Look at Aethoria—we have problems, but we solve them through debate, not decree. When our leaders fail, we replace them. When Thaldros's king fails, people suffer for generations. Which system sounds better to you?"*

**"You're paying less than Thaldros."**
{{descriptive
*"We're a republic, not a monarchy. We don't have royal vaults. But what we offer is worth more than gold: you'll be on the right side of history. Your children will sing songs of how you fought tyranny. Can Dawnblade offer you that?"*

**"What if democracy fails?"**
{{descriptive
*"Then we'll have tried something noble and failed nobly. But I don't believe we'll fail. The people WANT freedom. They WANT choice. Thaldros rules through fear and tradition. We inspire through hope. Hope is stronger."*

**"Will you ask us to do terrible things?"**
{{descriptive
*(Pauses, uncomfortable)*
{{descriptive
*"War is terrible. Revolution is messy. Will I ask you to kill Thaldros soldiers? Yes. Sabotage supply lines? Yes. These are necessary evils to defeat a greater evil. I won't lie and say our hands stay clean. But we fight for a just cause. That matters."*

**Insight DC 14:**
- Valen is genuine but naive about some realities
- He believes in his cause deeply
- He knows Aethoria leadership has corruption too
- He's willing to compromise principles to win
- He sees PCs as tools for necessary evil

**Persuasion DC 16 (to get him to reveal doubts):**
{{descriptive
*"You want the truth? Aethoria isn't perfect. Some senators are corrupt. Some officials abuse power. Democracy doesn't eliminate human nature.*
>
{{descriptive
*But here's the difference: in Thaldros, when the king is corrupt, you're stuck with him for life. In Aethoria, we can vote him out. The system has safeguards. It's not perfect, but it's better. That's all I can promise—better, not perfect."*

---

### **Valen'S Secret Agenda**

**What he's NOT telling PCs:**

1. **Corruption:** Aethoria senate is more corrupt than he admits
2. **Post-War:** Some leaders plan to establish "temporary dictatorship" after victory
3. **Defector:** They're protecting a war criminal (General Thorne) for his intelligence
4. **The War:** Republic knows it's outmatched but hoping for guerrilla victory

**This information revealed later in Quest 2.3 (The Double Cross)**

## Meeting 3: Corvus Blackwood (4pm)

### **The Setting**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*The third room is different. No fire. Candles instead. Bookshelves lining walls. Maps of ancient ruins scattered on table. Occult symbols—not evil, just... old.*
>
{{descriptive
*A man stands with his back to you, studying a map. He's in his 50s, wearing scholar's robes, grey hair tied back. When he turns, his eyes are intense—not mad, but focused with frightening clarity.*
>
{{descriptive
*"You came." His voice is measured, educated. "Good. That means you're thinking. Dawnblade offered order through oppression. Valen offered chaos through democracy. I offer a third option: burn it all down and build something better."*
>
{{descriptive
*He gestures to chairs.*
>
{{descriptive
*"My name is Corvus Blackwood. And I'm going to save the world."*

---

### **Corvus'S Pitch**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*He spreads a map—not of current Tirvandor, but of something else. Ancient. Before the Godsfall.*
>
{{descriptive
*"Both kingdoms are corrupt. Dawnblade serves a tyranny that oppresses millions. Valen serves a democracy that's descending into mob rule. They're not opposites—they're different flavors of failure.*
>
{{descriptive
*But there's a third option. During the Godsfall, when gods fought and shattered reality, they left something behind. Fragments of divine power—the World-Splitter Components.*
>
{{descriptive
*I've spent 30 years researching them. I've found one. Three more remain. With all five, I can use them to... restructure reality. End war. End poverty. End the suffering caused by flawed governments.*
>
{{descriptive
*Imagine a world without kings OR mobs. A world of true order—not Thaldros's oppressive order, but rational, benevolent coordination. Resources distributed fairly. Conflicts resolved peacefully. Everyone fed, housed, safe.*
>
{{descriptive
*That's what I'm building. Join me. Help me find the remaining Components. Help me save humanity from itself."*

**The "contract" he offers is more like a manifesto:**

**The Offer:**
- **Upfront Payment:** 1,000 gold pieces (least of three)
- **Per Mission:** 500-1,000gp + share of recovered artifacts
- **Authority:** None (you're outside the law)
- **Protection:** The Unbound network (underground cells)
- **Post-"War" Rewards:** Position as Wardens in New Order (govern regions)

**The Expectations:**
- Locate and retrieve World-Splitter Components
- Sabotage BOTH kingdoms (neither can win)
- Recruit powerful allies to the cause
- Publicly: "Fighting for freedom from both tyrannies"
- Privately: "Enabling reality restructuring"

---

### **Questions & Answers**

**If PCs ask questions:**

**"You're insane."**
{{descriptive
*"Am I? Look at history. Monarchies oppress. Democracies collapse. Theocracies control. Every system fails because humans are flawed. But what if we could... optimize? Remove the flaws? That's not insanity—that's vision."*

**"What do these Components actually do?"**
{{descriptive
*"They were used by gods during the Godsfall to... alter fundamental reality. Think of reality as a tapestry. The Components allow you to reweave specific threads. With all five, coordinated properly, we can restructure society at a foundational level.*
>
{{descriptive
*No more war—conflict becomes neurologically impossible. No more poverty—resources redistribute automatically. No more tyranny—power structures optimize for collective good."*

**"That sounds like you're removing free will."**
{{descriptive
*(Pauses, considering)*
{{descriptive
*"That's... a philosophical question. Is 'free will' to starve, wage war, and oppress each other truly freedom? Or is it a luxury we can't afford? I'm offering freedom FROM suffering. That's real freedom."*

**"What if you're wrong?"**
{{descriptive
*"Then millions continue suffering under failed systems. At least I'm TRYING to fix it. Dawnblade maintains oppression. Valen enables chaos. I offer actual change. Which is most moral?"*

**Insight DC 16:**
- Corvus is absolutely sincere
- He's brilliant but potentially delusional
- He genuinely believes he's saving the world
- He's aware using Components might kill millions
- He considers it acceptable cost for "perfect" future
- He's charismatic cult leader who believes own rhetoric

**Persuasion DC 18 (to get him to reveal the cost):**
{{descriptive
*"You want to know the truth? Using all five Components will... disrupt reality temporarily. The restructuring process might kill... 10-20% of population. Maybe 30%.*
>
{{descriptive
*That's millions dead. I'm aware. I've done the calculations. I've spent three years agonizing over this decision.*
>
{{descriptive
*But if we DON'T act? Wars kill millions over decades. Poverty kills millions over centuries. I'm offering to save billions at the cost of millions. That's... that's utilitarian calculus.*
>
{{descriptive
*I don't LIKE it. But I'll do it. Because someone has to make hard choices."*

---

### **Corvus'S Secret Agenda**

**What he's NOT telling PCs:**

1. **The Cost:** Actually 30-40% fatality rate (he's minimizing)
2. **Free Will:** Components WILL remove free will in restructured reality
3. **Permanence:** Effect is permanent—no going back
4. **His Instability:** Proximity to Component #1 is affecting his sanity
5. **The Unbound:** Some followers are extremists who want chaos, not utopia

**This information revealed later in Quest 2.3 (The Double Cross)**

---

## The Investigation Phase

**After meeting all three:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*Three offers. Three visions. Three futures.*
>
{{descriptive
*Dawnblade offers gold and order through tyranny. Valen offers ideals and chaos through democracy. Corvus offers transformation through apocalypse.*
>
{{descriptive
*You have three days to decide. All three recruiters made that clear—this opportunity won't wait forever. War is coming. Choose a side. Or try to play them all.*

---

### **Gathering Information**

**PCs can investigate all three factions before committing.**

**Suggested Activities:**

1. **Talk to NPCs from Act I**
   - Varak or Kael (guild leader): What do they think?
   - Mira (info broker): What rumors has she heard?
   - NPCs from previous quests: Which side did they choose?

2. **Research the Factions**
   - History checks about Thaldros
   - Investigation checks about Aethoria
   - Arcana checks about World-Splitter Components

3. **Observe Faction Actions**
   - Follow Dawnblade's soldiers
   - Watch Valen meet with contacts
   - Investigate Unbound hideout

---

### **Information Gathering Results**

**About Thaldros (History DC 15):**
- Kingdom has ruled 500+ years
- Stable but oppressive
- Efficient bureaucracy
- Common folk have little freedom but relative safety
- Recent decades: increasing corruption
- Marcus Blackwood case (if PCs know about it) is example of injustice

**About Aethoria (History DC 14):**
- Republic formed 80 years ago through revolution
- Democratic but unstable
- Mob rule common
- Amazing cultural output (art, science)
- Recent years: increasing corruption and faction fighting
- Many senators as corrupt as monarchs

**About the Unbound (Arcana DC 16):**
- Cult formed 10 years ago
- Led by Corvus Blackwood (scholar-turned-prophet)
- Obsessed with Godsfall artifacts
- Growing membership (2,000+ followers)
- Some members genuinely idealistic
- Others are apocalyptic extremists
- World-Splitter Components are REAL and DANGEROUS

---

### **Talking TO Act I Npcs**

**If PCs ask Varak (or Kael):**

**Varak (Iron Guild):**
{{descriptive
*"Thaldros. Always Thaldros. Order beats chaos every time. Aethoria's democracy is mob rule. And The Unbound? Cult nonsense. Take Dawnblade's gold and help maintain civilization."*

**Kael (Black Chains):**
{{descriptive
*"Play all three if you can. Get paid by everyone. When the war ends, whoever wins will need mercenaries. Loyalty is for soldiers. We're businessmen."*

**Mira (Info Broker):**
{{descriptive
*"Here's what I know: Dawnblade is honorable but following dishonorable orders. Valen is genuine but naive. Corvus is brilliant but insane. Pick your poison."*

**PCs from Quest 1.5 (if relevant):**

**If helped Marcus Blackwood:**
{{descriptive
*(Letter from Marcus, now in exile)*
{{descriptive
*"If you're reading this, war has begun. I urge you: side with Aethoria. Thaldros proved its injustice when it tried to silence me. Democracy is flawed, but it's our only hope against tyranny."*

**If delivered Marcus to trial:**
{{descriptive
*(Crown officials remember you favorably)*
{{descriptive
*"The crown appreciates your service. Commander Dawnblade has been instructed to offer you premium compensation."*

## DM Guidance

### **Running the Three Meetings**

- Don't rush the decision
- This choice affects entire Act II

**Presenting Fairly:**

- All have valid arguments
- All have hidden flaws

**Player Agency:**
- Some players will choose quickly
- Some will agonize
- Both are valid
- Don't force a choice until they're ready

### **If Players Try to Delay**

**All three recruiters give 3-day deadline:**

{{descriptive
*"War waits for no one. Three days. Then we find other mercenaries."*

**After 3 days:**
- Offers expire (can still work freelance but no bonuses)
- Other mercenary groups are hired
- War begins without them

### **If Players Can't Agree**

**Party may split:**
- Some join Thaldros
- Some join Aethoria
- Some go independent
- This is VALID and creates interesting dynamics
- Campaign continues with divided party (harder but doable)

### **The "Right" Choice**

**There isn't one.**

- Thaldros offers stability through oppression
- Aethoria offers freedom through chaos
- Unbound offers transformation through apocalypse
- All are morally grey
- Let players decide what matters to them

### **The Moral Choice**

**PCs must decide:**

#### **Option 1: DELIVER TO CORVUS (Complete Mission)**

**Actions:**
- Take Component back to Corvus
- Help his apocalyptic plan progress
- Enable "reshaping" of reality

**Consequences:**
- Full payment: 1,000gp + 1 ancient artifact
- Reputation: +5 with Unbound
- Component now in Corvus's hands (2 of 5 collected)
- Apocalypse one step closer
- You've enabled potential mass death

**Corvus's reaction:**

---

#### **Option 2: DESTROY COMPONENT**

**Actions:**
- Attempt to destroy the artifact
- Use magic, smashing, etc.

**Reality:**
- Component is nearly indestructible
- Requires *disintegrate* spell or similar high-level magic
- DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana) to figure out how

**If destroyed:**
- No payment (mission failed)
- Reputation: -10 with Unbound (hunted)
- Component eliminated (apocalypse harder to achieve)
- World slightly safer
- Corvus becomes enemy

**Corvus's reaction:**
{{descriptive
*"You DESTROYED it? Centuries of research! The hope of humanity! You've doomed millions to continued suffering. I'll never forgive this."*

---

#### **Option 3: KEEP COMPONENT**

**Actions:**
- Take artifact for yourself
- Don't return to Corvus
- Power in your hands (corrupting?)

**Consequences:**
- No payment (stole from employer)
- Reputation: -10 with Unbound (hunted)
- Component's influence on you (corruption)
- Both kingdoms hunt you (want Component)
- Future plot: What do YOU do with it?

**Every long rest: Wisdom save DC 14 or Component influences your decisions**

---

#### **Option 4: GIVE TO OPPOSING FACTION**

**Actions:**
- Deliver Component to Thaldros or Aethoria
- Betray Corvus
- Let kingdom study/use it

**Consequences:**
- Payment: 3,000gp from kingdom (major prize)
- Reputation: -10 with Unbound (hunted)
- Reputation: +10 with kingdom
- Kingdom now has Component (also dangerous)
- They'll study it for military advantage
- Different apocalypse risk

**Kingdom reaction:**
{{descriptive
*"Extraordinary! Our scholars will study this. Its power could win the war. You've served [kingdom name] well. You're a hero."*

**Later (Quest 2.4): Learn kingdom is weaponizing it**

---

#### **Option 5: HIDE COMPONENT**

**Deception DC 17:**

**Plan:**
- Claim Component was destroyed in trap
- Hide it somewhere secret
- Keep its location known only to you

**If successful:**
- Half payment: 500gp (failed mission)
- Component hidden (future plot point)
- Neither Corvus nor kingdoms have it
- World safer for now
- You know where ultimate power is buried

---

### **Aftermath**

**If Component delivered:**

**Two Weeks Later:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*You hear rumors. The Unbound are becoming more active. More aggressive. Corvus is gathering followers—hundreds joining. He's promising salvation. A better world. An end to war.*
>
{{descriptive
*But there's something in his eyes now—a fervor that wasn't there before. Proximity to two Components is affecting him. He's more convinced than ever that his path is right.*
>
{{descriptive
*You helped him get closer to that goal. For better or worse.*

---

**If Component destroyed/stolen:**

**Two Weeks Later:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*The Unbound are furious. Corvus put a bounty on your heads—2,000 gold, dead or alive. You're hunted by cultists who believe you destroyed their salvation.*
>
{{descriptive
*But others—scholars, clergy, common folk—thank you quietly. "You may have saved us," one priest says. "Those Components are too dangerous for anyone."*
>
{{descriptive
*Whether you did right or wrong, you made a powerful enemy.*

---

## 📋 Multiple Factions Option

**If PCs are working for multiple factions simultaneously:**

### **The Juggling Act**

**They receive multiple missions:**

**Thaldros wants:** Convoy destroyed  
**Aethoria wants:** Thorne extracted  
**Unbound wants:** Component retrieved

**PCs must:**
1. Complete all three (nearly impossible timing)
2. Prioritize one, fail others
3. Try creative solutions

**Example Creative Solution:**
- Complete Unbound mission first (3 days)
- Then split party: half does convoy, half does extraction
- High risk, high reward

**Consequences:**
- If succeed all: Maximum gold (5,000gp+)
- If fail any: That faction becomes suspicious
- Eventually discovered (Quest 2.3)
- All factions turn on you when revealed

---

## DM Guidance

### **Running Parallel Missions**

**Each mission tests different moral boundaries:**

**Thaldros (Convoy):**
- Tests: Willingness to harm innocents
- Theme: Collateral damage
- Question: "How far for gold?"

**Aethoria (Defector):**
- Tests: Justice vs pragmatism
- Theme: Moral compromise
- Question: "Does the end justify the means?"

**Unbound (Component):**
- Tests: Power vs safety
- Theme: Playing with fire
- Question: "Should some knowledge be forbidden?"

### **No Right Answers**

**All three missions are morally grey:**
- Completing helps your faction but has moral cost
- Refusing weakens faction but preserves conscience
- Creative solutions are possible but risky

**Don't judge players:**
- Present situation fairly
- Show consequences
- Let them decide
- All choices are valid

### **Consequences Matter**

**These choices echo through Act II:**

**If killed refugees (Convoy):**
- Civilian NPCs distrust you
- Aethoria sees you as monsters
- Thaldros gives more "difficult" missions

**If protected war criminal (Defector):**
- Justice subverted
- Survivors remember
- But Aethoria wins intelligence advantage

**If delivered Component:**
- Apocalypse closer
- Corvus more powerful
- World more dangerous

**Track all consequences for later quests**

>
{{descriptive

**What She Wants:**

---

### **Confrontation With Dawnblade**

**If PCs confront her with evidence:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*You storm into Dawnblade's office, documents in hand. She looks up, sees what you're holding, and her face falls.*
>
{{descriptive
*"Ah." She stands slowly. "Sarah. I should have watched her more closely."*
>
{{descriptive
*She doesn't deny it. Doesn't even try.*
>
{{descriptive
*"Yes. It's real. Scapegoat Protocol. Orders from high command. When the war ends, you'll be arrested. Tried for war crimes. Executed. The crown needs someone to blame, and mercenaries are perfect."*

**Insight DC 12:** She's deeply uncomfortable but resigned to following orders

**If PCs get angry:**

{{descriptive
*"You think I LIKE this? I'm a soldier. I follow orders. Even orders I hate. That's the oath I took. That's the burden I bear."*
>
{{descriptive
*(Her voice cracks slightly)*
>
{{descriptive
*"For what it's worth... you're good people. You did the dirty work no one else would do. And yes, you'll die for it. That's the price of serving power. I'm sorry."*

**If PCs threaten her:**

{{descriptive
*"Kill me if you want. Won't change anything. Scapegoat Protocol is official. My replacement will execute it. You can't fight the entire kingdom."*

---

### **The CHOICE (Thaldros Path)**

**PCs must decide:**

#### **Option 1: FLEE THALDROS**

**Actions:**
- Contact Envoy Valen
- Offer to defect with intelligence
- Join Aethoria cause

**Envoy Valen's Response:**
{{descriptive
*"Thaldros betrayed you? I'm not surprised. They devour their own. Join us. We'll protect you. Plus, your intelligence on Thaldros operations is invaluable. Welcome to the Republic."*

**Consequences:**

- Reputation: +10 with Aethoria
- Reputation: -20 with Thaldros (traitors)
- Now working for opposite side
- War continues, you've switched teams

---

#### **Option 3: BLACKMAIL THALDROS**

**Intimidation DC 18 to make Dawnblade back down:**

**If successful:**
{{descriptive
*"You want to negotiate? Fine. I'll report Scapegoat Protocol 'failed' due to security leak. You'll be marked as liabilities instead of assets. They won't actively hunt you, but they won't protect you either. You'll be on your own. Deal?"*

**Consequences:**
- Thaldros backs off (you're too risky to arrest)
- No payment, no support, no protection
- Technically independent
- Can work for anyone now
- Thaldros watches you but doesn't attack
- Uneasy truce

---

#### **Option 4: ACCEPT FATE**

**Decide to stay loyal despite betrayal:**

**Why PCs might choose this:**
- Believe in Thaldros cause despite corruption
- Pragmatic acceptance of mercenary risks
- Too invested to quit
- Think they can survive trial somehow

**Consequences:**
- Continue working for Thaldros
- Know you'll be arrested when war ends
- Try to gather evidence to exonerate selves
- Or plan escape for later
- Living on borrowed time

---

**Kill Dawnblade, expose Scapegoat Protocol publicly:**

**If you kill her:**
- Immediate alarm
- 20 **Thaldros Guards** respond (CR 1/8 each)
- Must fight way out or die

**If you expose protocol:**
- Publish documents to press/public
- Major scandal for crown
- Some nobles support you, others hunt you
- Public opinion divided
- Crown furious but can't openly retaliate

- Massive political fallout

# 🗽 IF Working For Aethoria

## The Document

**Senate Internal Memo (appears authentic):**

{{descriptive
**FROM:** Senator Council Leadership  
{{descriptive
**TO:** Envoy Valen  
{{descriptive
**RE:** Post-War Governance Structure  
>
{{descriptive
*Once victory secured, initiate Phase Two: Democratic Consolidation.*
>
{{descriptive
*Translation: Suspend elections "temporarily." Establish emergency council of senators (us). Grant ourselves extraordinary powers "until stability restored."*
>
{{descriptive
*We fought for democracy. We'll rule through democracy. Just... guided democracy. The people aren't ready for full self-governance. They need strong leaders.*
>
{{descriptive
*Valen: Your mercenaries have served well. After victory, they know too much. Offer them command positions in remote territories. Keep them busy. If they refuse, frame as Thaldros collaborators. Trial. Exile.*
>
{{descriptive
*The revolution must be protected. Even from those who fought for it.*

**Investigation DC 15:** Document appears genuine (senate seals, authentic signatures)

---

## The Meeting

**Old Mill, Midnight**

**The Informant:** **marcus thorne** (the defector from Quest 2.2, if he survived)

**If Thorne died in Quest 2.2, use different informant:**

**Alternative: JULIA REDWIND** (Aethoria intelligence officer, similar stats to Sarah Vale)

**Thorne'S Revelation:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*General Marcus Thorne stands in the shadows. He looks even more haunted than before.*
>
{{descriptive
*"I defected from Thaldros because I saw what tyranny does. Now I'm watching Aethoria become the same thing. Different name. Same poison.*
>
{{descriptive
*(He hands you documents)*
>
{{descriptive
*"The senate leadership—not all, but enough—they're planning a coup. Democracy was always a tool. Once they win the war, they'll suspend elections. Rule as oligarchs. Everything we fought for... a lie.*
>
{{descriptive
*And you? You're too dangerous. You know too much. They'll either exile you or frame you as traitors. I've seen this pattern before. I helped Thaldros do it."*

---

### **Confrontation With Valen**

**If PCs confront him:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*Valen looks at the documents. His face falls. He sits heavily.*
>
{{descriptive
*"It's true." His voice is quiet, defeated. "Not me—I genuinely believe in democracy. But the senate leadership... yes. They plan to consolidate power after the war.*
>
{{descriptive
*(He looks at you, eyes pleading)*
>
{{descriptive
*"But don't you see? We're fighting Thaldros tyranny. If we don't have strong leadership during the transition, everything falls apart. Maybe... maybe temporary emergency powers are necessary. Just until stability—"*
>
{{descriptive
*(He stops, hearing himself)*
>
{{descriptive
*"Gods. I sound like them. I'm making excuses for tyranny."*

**Insight DC 13:** Valen is genuinely conflicted—he really believes in democracy but has rationalized compromise

**If PCs press him:**

{{descriptive
*"You want the truth? I KNEW. I knew some senators had this plan. I told myself it wouldn't happen. That we'd stop it after victory. That democracy would prevail.*
>
{{descriptive
*But I also knew that if I opposed them openly, I'd be removed. Replaced with someone worse. So I... cooperated. Kept my head down. Told myself I was being pragmatic.*
>
{{descriptive
*(Ashamed)*
>
{{descriptive
*I'm a hypocrite. I fought for democracy while enabling its betrayal. You deserved better."*

---

### **The CHOICE (Aethoria Path)**

**PCs must decide:**

#### **Option 1: FLEE AETHORIA**

**Actions:**
- Leave Republic immediately
- Become independent
- Avoid both kingdoms

**Consequences:**
- Wanted by Aethoria government
- Bounty: 3,000gp
- Lost faith in democracy (it failed)
- Can work as independents
- Cynical but free

---

#### **Option 2: SWITCH TO THALDROS**

**Actions:**
- Contact Commander Dawnblade
- Offer intelligence on Aethoria
- Join monarchy

**Dawnblade's Response:**
{{descriptive
*"Aethoria betrayed you? Democracy always fails. Welcome to the side of order. We'll pay well for your intelligence. 3,000 gold. Plus, when we win, you'll be rewarded properly."*

**Consequences:**
- Thaldros pays 3,000gp for defection
- Reputation: +10 with Thaldros
- Reputation: -20 with Aethoria (traitors)
- Irony: fought for freedom, joined tyranny
- But at least tyranny is honest about being tyranny

---

#### **Option 3: SAVE DEMOCRACY**

**Work with Valen to expose corrupt senators:**

**Persuasion DC 16 to convince Valen to help:**

**If successful:**
{{descriptive
*"You're right. If democracy is worth fighting for, it's worth fighting for HONESTLY. Help me. We'll expose the corrupt senators. Force public trials. Restore true democracy. It's risky—they'll try to kill us—but it's RIGHT."*

**The Campaign:**
- Gather more evidence (3 skill challenges)
- Build coalition of honest senators (social encounters)
- Public reveal at senate session (dramatic scene)
- Face political assassination attempts (2 combat encounters)

**If successful:**
- Corrupt senators removed
- Democracy preserved
- You're heroes of the TRUE revolution
- Aethoria remains flawed but honest

**Consequences:**
- Partial payment: 1,000gp (from grateful honest senators)
- Reputation: +15 with common people
- Reputation: +5 with honest senators
- Reputation: -20 with corrupt politicians (now enemies)
- Democracy survives but wounded

---

#### **Option 4: ACCEPT OLIGARCHY**

**Decide corrupt senate is better than Thaldros:**

**Rationalization:**
- "Guided democracy" is still better than monarchy
- Pragmatic acceptance
- Lesser evil
- At least they'll rule competently

**Consequences:**
- Continue working for Aethoria
- Know democracy is dying
- Help establish oligarchy
- Payment continues but conscience damaged
- Become tools of hypocrisy

---

#### **Option 5: ANARCHIST REVOLUTION**

**Burn it all down—expose both kingdoms:**

**Actions:**
- Leak corruption evidence publicly
- Reveal Thaldros Scapegoat Protocol too
- Undermine both governments
- Create power vacuum

**Consequences:**
- Both kingdoms destabilized
- Chaos spreads
- You're wanted by EVERYONE
- Common folk divided (some support, some blame you)
- Unbound (Corvus) sees opportunity
- You've started regional collapse

---

# 🔥 IF Working For The Unbound

## The Document

**Corvus's Private Journal (stolen pages):**

{{descriptive
**Journal Entry—Month 7**
>
{{descriptive
*The Components' power is intoxicating. Two secured. Three remain. Soon.*
>
{{descriptive
*Initial calculations: restructuring will cause 30-40% population casualties. Acceptable cost for perfect world. Mercenaries don't need to know exact numbers. Tell them "some" will die. They're mercenaries—pragmatic.*
>
{{descriptive
**Month 9**
>
{{descriptive
*Proximity to Components affecting my judgment? No. I'm thinking more clearly than ever. The old world MUST burn. All of it.*
>
{{descriptive
*If mercenaries refuse final phase, eliminate them. Too dangerous to leave alive. They know too much about Components' locations.*
>
{{descriptive
**Month 11**
>
{{descriptive
*Final restructuring will remove free will. Only way to ensure perfection. Humans make wrong choices. We'll make choices FOR them. They'll thank us eventually. Or... they won't be capable of dissent anymore.*
>
{{descriptive
*Is this evil? No. It's necessity. I'm saving humanity by making them something better. Something controlled.*

**Investigation DC 14:** Handwriting matches Corvus's other documents (authentic)

### **Confrontation With Corvus**

**If PCs confront him:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*Corvus looks at the journal pages. His expression shifts—not shame, but annoyance.*
>
{{descriptive
*"Elara. Always too sentimental." He looks at you calmly. "Yes. It's all true. 30-40% casualties. Free will removal. Necessary steps for perfect world.*
>
{{descriptive
*(He's not apologetic. He's EXPLAINING.)*
>
{{descriptive
*"You're mercenaries. You understand hard choices. Sometimes you must kill to save. This is that, scaled up. Kill millions to save billions.*
>
{{descriptive
*The old world is BROKEN. War. Poverty. Oppression. I can FIX it. Make humanity perfect. Isn't that worth the cost?"*

**Insight DC 15:** He's completely serious and genuinely believes this is right

**If PCs call him insane:**

{{descriptive
*"Insane? I'm the ONLY sane one. Look at the world! Thaldros murders refugees. Aethoria betrays its own ideals. Endless cycles of suffering. I'm offering to END that.*
>
{{descriptive
*Yes, the price is high. Yes, you'll lose free will. But you'll also lose suffering. Pain. War. Isn't that worth it?"*

**If PCs threaten to stop him:**

{{descriptive
*(Sadly)*
{{descriptive

## DM Guidance

### **Running The Betrayal**

**Make it hurt:**
- PCs trusted their faction
- Faction genuinely betrayed them
- Not "misunderstanding"—real treachery
- Forces difficult decision

**But make it understandable:**
- Factions have logical reasons
- Not "evil for evil's sake"
- Pragmatic but wrong
- Grey, not black

### **The Confrontation Scene**

**Let faction leaders defend themselves:**
- They have reasons
- They're not apologizing
- They believe they're right
- Might even respect PCs for discovering truth

**Don't make them cartoonishly evil:**
- Dawnblade follows orders (lawful evil)
- Valen compromised principles (conflicted good)
- Corvus believes own rhetoric (chaotic neutral)

### **Player Agency**

**All choices are valid:**
- Stay loyal = pragmatic
- Switch sides = adaptive
- Go independent = principled
- Expose corruption = heroic
- Violence = emotional

**Don't judge:**
- Present options
- Show consequences
- Let them decide
- Respect their choice

### **Consequences**

**This choice matters ENORMOUSLY:**
- Determines Quest 2.4-2.5 structure
- Affects Act III options
- Creates permanent allegiances/enemies
- Shapes campaign endgame

**Track carefully:**
- Who they joined
- Who they betrayed
- Who they exposed
- Who died

### **If Working For Aethoria:**

**Envoy Valen (if still employed):**
{{descriptive
*"Thaldros keeps evidence of their crimes in the vault—including proof of manufactured atrocities. We need those documents to turn public opinion. Also, military intelligence. Payment: 3,000 gold plus whatever you find."*

### **If Working For Unbound:**

**Corvus Blackwood (if still employed):**
{{descriptive

## Phase 1: Intelligence Gathering

**One week to prepare. PCs must gather intel:**

### **Research Checks**

**History DC 14 (Vault Background):**
{{descriptive
*Royal Vault built 300 years ago by dwarf architects. Five levels deep. Never successfully robbed. Three attempted heists—all thieves executed.*

> 5. *Guardian (construct, never seen, only legends)*

**Persuasion DC 15 (Insider Information):**

**If PCs find former guard:**
{{descriptive
*"I worked vault security for five years. Shifts change at midnight. East entrance has blind spot. Wards can be temporarily dispelled if you have the right magic. But the Guardian... that's your real problem. No one knows what it is. Some say dragon. Some say demon. I say: don't find out."*

**Advantages:** Guards don't suspect  
**Disadvantages:** Requires multiple successful checks

---

**Approach 3: Distraction**

**Requirements:**

**Plan:**

---

**Approach 4: Magical**

**Requirements:**
- High-level spells
- Teleportation or dimension door
- Dispel magic at 7th+ level

**Plan:**
- Bypass wards magically
- Teleport directly into vault

## The Choice Point

**PCs must decide (can take 1-2 sessions to deliberate):**

# 🏰 Path 1: Thaldros Victory

**If PCs choose to fight for Thaldros:**

## The Battle

### **Deployment**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*Dawn breaks. You stand with Thaldros vanguard—500 elite soldiers. Commander Dawnblade briefs you:*
>
{{descriptive
*"Aethoria's left flank is weak. Volunteers, poor training. Break through there. Collapse their line. Victory is ours. You lead the charge. For the kingdom!"*
>
{{descriptive
*Behind you: 10,000 Thaldros soldiers.*  
{{descriptive
*Across the field: 8,000 Republican defenders.*  
{{descriptive
*Above: Carrion birds, waiting.*

---

### **Phase 1: The CHARGE**

**PCs lead 500 soldiers against Aethoria left flank:**

**Encounter:**
- 300 **Aethoria Militia** (Commoner stats, CR 0, poorly trained)
- 50 **Republican Veterans** (Guard stats, CR 1/8)
- 1 **Republican Commander** (Knight stats, CR 3)

**This is a massacre.**

**PCs can:**
- **Fight honorably:** Kill only soldiers, spare surrendering
- **Fight ruthlessly:** Kill everyone, break morale faster
- **Show mercy:** Try to minimize casualties (harder)

**Combat Summary (not every soldier):**
- Militia breaks after 50% casualties
- Veterans fight to last man
- Commander demands single combat (PC can accept)

**If PCs win:**
- Left flank collapses
- Thaldros floods through breach
- Aethoria line crumbles

---

### **Phase 2: The PURSUIT**

**Aethoria forces retreat:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*They're running. Aethoria soldiers fleeing in disarray. Dawnblade orders: "Pursue! No quarter! End this!"*
>
{{descriptive
*You see them: terrified young soldiers, farmers with spears, people who believed in democracy. Running for their lives.*
>
{{descriptive
*Orders are orders. But...*

**The Choice:**

**Option A: Follow Orders**
- Pursue and kill retreating soldiers
- War crime but effective
- Aethoria routed completely
- Thaldros victory assured

**Option B: Show Mercy**
- Let them retreat
- Disobey orders
- Dawnblade furious but battle won anyway

---

### **Phase 3: The Final Stand**

**Boss Fight:**

**Envoy Valen (if alive) + Republican Champions:**

**Envoy Valen** (CR 6, as previous stats)  
**4 Republican Champions** (Veteran stats, CR 3 each)

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*Valen stands defiant, bloody, defeated but not broken:*
>
{{descriptive
*"So. You chose tyranny. I hope it's everything you dreamed. When the king turns on you—and he will—remember this moment. Remember you had a choice."*

**PCs can:**
- **Kill them:** Complete victory, no mercy
- **Capture them:** Take prisoners, war trials later
- **Let them flee:** Final mercy (Dawnblade will be angry)

---

### **Outcome: Thaldros Victory**

**If Thaldros wins:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*Aethoria falls. Republic collapses. Democracy dies on this field.*

>
{{descriptive
*You're heroes of the kingdom. Commander Dawnblade promotes you. King grants titles, lands, gold.*

{{descriptive
*But walking through the battlefield afterward, you see: 3,000 dead. Mostly Aethoria militia—farmers, shopkeepers, people who believed freedom was worth fighting for.*
>
{{descriptive
*You helped create this. You helped tyranny win.*

{{descriptive
*Was it worth it?*

**Rewards:**

# 🗽 Path 2: Aethoria Victory

**If PCs choose to fight for Aethoria:**

## The Defense

### **Deployment**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*You stand with Aethoria defenders—outnumbered, outmatched, but not outspirited. Envoy Valen addresses troops:*
>
{{descriptive
*"They have more soldiers. Better armor. Royal gold. We have something they don't: we're fighting for our freedom. Today, we prove democracy is worth dying for. For the Republic!"*
>
{{descriptive
*Behind you: 8,000 Republicans.*  
{{descriptive
*Across the field: 10,000 Thaldros soldiers.*

**Boss Fight:**

**Commander Dawnblade (if alive) + Honor Guard:**

**Commander Helena Dawnblade** (CR 10, as previous stats)  
**6 Royal Knights** (Knight stats, CR 3 each)

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*Dawnblade makes final stand, surrounded but unbroken:*
>

>
{{descriptive
*(She raises her sword)*
>
{{descriptive
*"But I'm still a soldier. I'll die like one."*

**PCs can:**

**If PCs choose to help Corvus:**

## The Heist During Battle

### **The Plan**

**Corvus explains:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*"While they slaughter each other, we steal what matters. King Aldric IV carries Component #4 as protective talisman. General Marcus Vale (Aethoria) has Component #5. They don't know what they carry.*
>
{{descriptive
*You infiltrate both sides during battle chaos. Steal both Components. Bring them to me. I'll perform the ritual.*
>
{{descriptive
*Tomorrow, we remake the world. No more war. No more suffering. Perfection.*
>
{{descriptive
*(His eyes are wild, intense)*

{{descriptive
*This is what we've worked for. This is salvation."*

- **Combat:** Assassinate General, take Component
- **Persuasion:** Convince him to give it up (nearly impossible)

---

### **Phase 3: The RITUAL**

**Deliver Components to Corvus:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*You return to Corvus with both Components. He now has all five. His hands shake with anticipation.*
>
{{descriptive
*"Perfect. PERFECT! Now, the ritual. Reality will bend. The world will change. Humanity will be saved."*
>
{{descriptive
*(He begins arranging Components in circle—intricate pattern, glowing with power)*
>
{{descriptive
*"When I activate this, 30-40% of population will die. Necessary sacrifice. The rest will enter new world order. No free will, but no suffering. Perfect peace. Perfect control."*
>
{{descriptive
*(He looks at you)*
>
{{descriptive
*"Are you with me? Or do you lack the courage to save humanity?"*

---

### **The Final Choice**

**PCs must decide:**

**Option A: LET RITUAL COMPLETE**

**Corvus succeeds:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*Corvus chants. Components pulse with power. Reality TEARS.*
>
{{descriptive
*Across the battlefield, soldiers stop fighting. They CHANGE. Eyes glaze. Expressions flatten. Free will... gone.*
>
{{descriptive
*Cities across the world: Same effect. Millions simply... stop. Then fall. Dead. Necessary casualties.*
>
{{descriptive
*You feel it—pull on your mind. But Components protect you. You're exempt. Wardens of New Order.*
>
{{descriptive
*The old world dies. The new world is born.*

**Outcome: UNBOUND APOCALYPSE**

**Consequences:**
- 35% of world population dies (instant)
- Remaining 65% lose free will

**If all negotiations successful AND survived assassinations:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive

{{descriptive
*You brokered peace. Ended a war. Saved thousands of lives.*
>
{{descriptive
*Statues erected in your honor. Songs sung. "The Peacemakers," they call you.*
>

**Rewards:**
- 3,000gp (from grateful citizens' fund)

**Outcome: TOTAL WAR**

**Rewards:**

---

## DM Guidance

### **Running the Finale**

**Make it EPIC:**
- This is Act II climax
- Armies, magic, politics
- Everything players did matters
- High stakes, high drama

**But keep it personal:**
- Focus on PCs' actions
- Don't get lost in armies (abstract large battles)
- Individual choices matter
- Their story, not generals' story

### **The Five Outcomes**

**Present all as equally valid:**
- No "correct" ending
- Each has costs and benefits
- PCs choose based on values
- All paths lead to Act III

**Track everything:**
- Which outcome occurred
- Who lived/died
- What was revealed
- What remains hidden
- This determines all of Act III

### **Player Agency**

**Ultimate test:**
- Can PCs broker peace? (Path 4)
- Or do they choose a side? (Paths 1-2)
- Or enable apocalypse? (Path 3)
- Or do nothing? (Path 5)

**All are valid choices.**

**Respect their decision and show consequences honestly.**

}}

**Level:** 11  
**Duration:** 2-3 sessions

**Key NPCs:** Dawnblade, Valen, border officials, extremists  
**Rewards:** 2,000gp + reputation as Peacemakers  
**Theme:** "Peace requires constant vigilance"

---

## Act III Opening

**Time:** One year after Act II finale

**The State of the World:**

You achieved the impossible in Act II—you stopped the war. You exposed the conspiracy, forced both kingdoms to the negotiating table, and brokered the Treaty of Judgment Border.

But peace is fragile. Daily.

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*One year has passed since you prevented the war. The Treaty of Judgment Border holds—barely.*
>
{{descriptive
*The frontier territories exist in uneasy peace with the Crown. Trade resumed. Prisoners exchanged. Diplomatic relations established. From the outside, it looks like peace.*
>
{{descriptive
*From the inside? You know better. You're the official Peacekeepers—neutral mediators appointed by both kingdoms. Every week brings new crises. Border disputes. Trade disagreements. Assassination attempts. Diplomatic incidents.*
>
{{descriptive
*You prevent them. One crisis at a time. One day at a time. It's exhausting.*
>
{{descriptive
*But today is worse than usual. Three separate incidents. Same day. All threatening to reignite the war.*
>
{{descriptive
*This is your life now. Welcome to Level 11. Welcome to Act III.*

---

## The Three Crises

**All three occur simultaneously. PCs must prioritize:**

---

## Crisis 1: The Border Incident

**Location:** Judgment Border Checkpoint

**What Happened:**

Thaldros guards killed an Aethoria merchant they claim was smuggling weapons. Aethoria says he was unarmed, carrying legal trade goods. Both sides mobilizing troops.

### **Arrival**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*You arrive at the border checkpoint to find 50 Thaldros soldiers on one side, 40 Aethoria militia on the other. The dead merchant's body lies in no-man's-land. No one will retrieve it—crossing the line might spark violence.*
>
{{descriptive
*Thaldros Captain: "He was smuggling swords! We have every right to enforce border security!"*
>
{{descriptive
*Aethoria Lieutenant: "You murdered an unarmed civilian! This is an act of war!"*
>
{{descriptive
*Weapons drawn. Fingers on triggers. One wrong word and this explodes.*

---

### **Investigation**

**PCs can investigate the scene:**

**Perception DC 16 (examining body from distance):**
{{descriptive
*The merchant has no visible weapons. His cart contains... textiles? Cloth bolts. No swords visible.*

**Medicine DC 14:**
{{descriptive
*Crossbow bolt to the back. He was fleeing, not attacking.*

**Investigation DC 17 (examining cart closely):**
{{descriptive
*Hidden compartment. Empty. But residue suggests swords WERE here recently. Someone removed them.*

**Insight DC 15 (reading soldiers):**
{{descriptive
*Thaldros captain looks nervous. He's hiding something. Aethoria lieutenant is genuinely enraged—believes merchant was innocent.*

---

### **The TRUTH**

**If PCs investigate thoroughly:**

**Perception DC 18 (searching area):**
{{descriptive
*Fresh wagon tracks leading away from checkpoint. Someone else was here. Recently.*

**Survival DC 16 (tracking):**
{{descriptive
*Tracks lead to nearby woods. You find: abandoned cart with 20 swords. Thaldros military issue.*

**The Truth:**
- Merchant WAS smuggling (Thaldros correct)
- BUT Thaldros guards PLANTED the swords (framed him)
- Then killed him when he discovered the frame job
- Third party (unknown) removed evidence to hide the setup

**Someone wanted this incident to spark war.**

---

### **The RESOLUTION**

**PCs must decide:**

**Option 1: Expose Thaldros Frame Job**
- Confront Thaldros captain with evidence
- Public admission of murder
- Thaldros embarrassed but truth revealed
- **Persuasion DC 18** to get captain to confess

**If successful:**
- Thaldros apologizes formally
- Captain arrested
- Aethoria satisfied
- Peace holds
- **Reward:** Reputation +5 with Aethoria, +2 with Thaldros (transparency)

**If failed:**
- Thaldros denies everything
- Both sides stay angry
- Tension remains high

---

**Option 2: Blame Third Party**
- Present evidence of unknown wagon
- Suggest someone framed BOTH sides
- Shift anger toward mutual enemy
- **Persuasion DC 16** (easier, shared enemy unites)

**If successful:**
- Both sides agree to joint investigation
- Cooperation instead of confrontation
- Peace holds
- But truth remains hidden
- **Reward:** Reputation +3 with both kingdoms

---

**Option 3: Peaceful Lie**
- Claim merchant was innocent, hide evidence
- Demand Thaldros compensate family
- Political solution, not truth
- **Deception DC 18**

**If successful:**
- Thaldros pays blood money
- Aethoria satisfied
- Peace holds
- But Thaldros resentful
- **Reward:** Reputation +5 Aethoria, -2 Thaldros

---

**Option 4: Escalate**
- Refuse to mediate
- Let them fight it out
- **This breaks the peace**
- Fail quest, war resumes

---

## Crisis 2: The Trade Dispute

**Location:** Port City of Seahaven (neutral ground)

**What Happened:**

Aethoria merchant ship seized by Thaldros navy for "illegal goods." Aethoria demands release. Thaldros refuses. Both threaten embargo.

### **The SITUATION**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*Seahaven Port. The merchant ship "Liberty's Call" sits anchored, Thaldros navy blockading it. Aethoria diplomats argue with Thaldros admirals on the dock. Merchants on both sides watching nervously—if trade stops, everyone loses money.*
>
{{descriptive
*Thaldros Admiral: "The ship carries Unbound propaganda. Books. Pamphlets. Cult materials. We can't allow that poison into our kingdom."*
>
{{descriptive
*Aethoria Diplomat: "Freedom of speech! We don't censor! Release the ship or we close ALL trade!"*
>
{{descriptive
*Merchant guilds are panicking. If trade stops, both economies suffer. But neither side will back down.*

---

### **Investigation**

**Persuasion DC 15 to board the ship:**

**What PCs find:**
- 200 crates of legitimate trade goods
- 5 crates of books (Unbound philosophy)
- Books are: Critical of monarchy AND democracy
- Call for "new order" (Corvus-style rhetoric)
- NOT illegal in Aethoria (free speech)
- VERY illegal in Thaldros (sedition)

**Investigation DC 16:**
{{descriptive
*The books were loaded by someone named "Brother Ash"—Unbound member. He's listed as passenger, not crew.*

**Insight DC 14:**
{{descriptive
*This isn't about the books. Thaldros wants excuse to flex power. Aethoria wants excuse to resist. Both testing the treaty.*

---

### **The TRUTH**

**If PCs dig deeper:**

**Investigation DC 18 (ship manifest):**
{{descriptive
*Brother Ash paid 500gp to load books. Ship captain didn't know contents. He's innocent. Books were smuggled aboard.*

**Unbound are testing the peace.** If kingdoms fight over books, war resumes. Unbound wins.

---

### **The RESOLUTION**

**Option 1: Confiscate Books, Release Ship**
- Compromise: Remove illegal cargo, release ship
- Neither side wins completely
- **Persuasion DC 16** to get both to agree

**If successful:**
- Trade continues
- Thaldros gets security
- Aethoria maintains trade
- Peace holds
- **Reward:** Reputation +3 both kingdoms

---

**Option 2: Defend Free Speech**
- Argue books are legal in international waters
- Force Thaldros to release ship
- **Persuasion DC 18** (harder, challenges Thaldros authority)

**If successful:**
- Ship released with books
- Aethoria celebrates victory
- Thaldros resentful
- Peace holds but strained
- **Reward:** Reputation +5 Aethoria, -3 Thaldros

---

**Option 3: Support Seizure**
- Agree books are dangerous
- Ship stays seized
- **Persuasion DC 17** (need to convince Aethoria)

**If successful:**
- Thaldros keeps ship
- Aethoria backs down
- Peace holds but strained
- **Reward:** Reputation +5 Thaldros, -3 Aethoria

---

**Option 4: Expose Unbound Plot**
- Reveal Brother Ash smuggled books
- Frame as Unbound sabotage
- Unite kingdoms against shared enemy
- **Investigation DC 17 to find Brother Ash**

**If successful:**
- Both kingdoms cooperate
- Hunt Unbound together
- Peace strengthened
- **Reward:** Reputation +5 both kingdoms
- **Bonus:** Lead to Brother Ash (can arrest/question)

---

## Crisis 3: The Assassination Attempt

**Location:** Diplomatic Summit (neutral ground)

**What Happened:**

Someone tried to assassinate Envoy Valen during peace summit. Aethoria blames Thaldros. Thaldros denies it. Summit collapsing.

### **The SCENE**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*You arrive at the summit building to chaos. Envoy Valen is alive—barely. Crossbow bolt missed his heart by inches. He's conscious, bleeding, furious.*
>
{{descriptive
*Valen: "Thaldros tried to kill me! So much for peace!"*
>
{{descriptive
*Commander Dawnblade: "We did NO such thing! This is a frame job!"*
>
{{descriptive
*Security found the assassin's position—rooftop across street. Bolt is Thaldros military issue. Valen's guards want blood. Dawnblade's honor guards are defensive. Violence is imminent unless you stop it.*

---

### **Investigation**

**Perception DC 15 (examining bolt):**
{{descriptive
*Thaldros military crossbow bolt. Standard issue. Available to thousands of soldiers.*

**Investigation DC 17 (examining rooftop):**
{{descriptive
*Sniper position well-chosen. Professional. But... something's off. The angle is wrong. Bolt should have killed Valen easily. This shooter either missed badly or missed on purpose.*

**Medicine DC 16 (examining Valen's wound):**
{{descriptive
*Bolt trajectory suggests deliberate near-miss. One inch right and Valen dies. This wasn't incompetence—it was precision missing.*

**Investigation DC 18 (rooftop evidence):**
{{descriptive
*Boot prints. Military boots. Size 10. Also: black fabric thread caught on roof tile. Not Thaldros colors—that's Unbound black.*

---

### **The TRUTH**

**The assassin was Unbound, not Thaldros.**

They used Thaldros equipment to frame them. Deliberately missed Valen (wanted to wound, not kill—dead martyr less useful than angry victim). Goal: Reignite war.

**If PCs find Brother Ash from Crisis 2:** He knows about assassin. Can be interrogated.

---

### **The RESOLUTION**

**Option 1: Blame Thaldros**
- Present bolt as evidence
- Demand Thaldros accountability
- **Persuasion DC 16** (Valen wants this)

**If successful:**
- Thaldros apologizes (even though innocent)
- Pays reparations
- Peace holds but resentment grows
- **Reward:** Reputation +5 Aethoria, -5 Thaldros
- **Long-term:** Thaldros eventually discovers truth, furious at injustice

---

**Option 2: Prove Frame Job**
- Present evidence of Unbound involvement
- Show deliberate near-miss
- **Investigation DC 18 to convince both sides**

**If successful:**
- Both kingdoms realize they're being manipulated
- Joint task force against Unbound
- Peace strengthened
- **Reward:** Reputation +5 both kingdoms
- **Bonus:** Hunt for Unbound begins (Quest 3.2 setup)

---

**Option 3: Cover-Up**
- Claim assassin died escaping
- No one to blame
- Move past incident
- **Deception DC 19** (very hard, Valen suspicious)

**If successful:**
- No blame assigned
- Summit continues
- Peace holds
- But mystery remains
- **Reward:** Reputation +2 both (neither fully satisfied)

---

**Option 4: Independent Investigation**
- Demand time to investigate properly
- Delay judgment
- **Persuasion DC 17** to get both sides to wait

**If successful:**
- 1 day to investigate
- Can find more evidence
- Better resolution possible
- But risky (tempers high)

---

## The Pattern

**If PCs investigate all three crises thoroughly:**

**Insight DC 17:**
{{descriptive
*These aren't coincidences. Same day. All designed to provoke war. Someone's coordinating this.*

**Investigation DC 18 (connecting evidence):**
{{descriptive
*Brother Ash connected to two incidents. Unbound black fabric at assassination. The hidden cart from border incident had Unbound symbols scratched inside.*

**The Revelation:**

**The Unbound are sabotaging the peace.**

Corvus (if alive) or Unbound remnants are deliberately creating incidents to restart war. Why? Chaos serves their goals.

**This sets up Quest 3.2: The Underground**

---

## Aftermath

**End of session:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*You handled three crises in one day. Three potential wars prevented. Three diplomatic victories (or compromises, or failures—depending on choices).*
>
{{descriptive
*But as you return to your quarters, exhausted, you realize: This is your life now. Every day. Every week. The peace doesn't maintain itself. It requires constant, thankless, exhausting work.*
>
{{descriptive
*And someone's actively trying to break it.*
>
{{descriptive
*(A messenger arrives with three more urgent dispatches)*
>
{{descriptive
*"More incidents. Northern border. Western trade route. Southern diplomatic mission. All need Peacekeeper intervention."*
>
{{descriptive
*Welcome to Act III. This is what you earned in Act II. The privilege of defending what you built.*

---

**If All Three crises resolved successfully:**
- 2,000gp from grateful kingdoms

---

## Level Up

**PCs remain Level 11** after this quest.

This quest establishes Act III pattern: constant crisis management.

---

## New Npcs For Compendium

**Add these:**

1. **Thaldros Border Captain Marcus Stone** (Knight, CR 3) - nervous, hiding guilt
2. **Frontier Lieutenant Sara Brightwind** (Veteran, CR 3) - righteous anger
3. **Thaldros Admiral Viktor Seaworth** (Knight, CR 5) - rigid, lawful
4. **Aethoria Diplomat Chen Aldermist** (Noble, CR 2) - idealist
5. **Brother Ash** (Unbound Agitator, Priest, CR 7) - if captured

---

## DM Guidance

### **Running Multiple Crises**

**Don't make PCs solve all simultaneously:**
- They prioritize (which matters most?)
- Delegate (can send allies to handle one)
- Accept imperfect solutions

**Time Pressure:**
- Each crisis has deadline
- Can't perfectly solve all
- Forces hard choices

### **The Investigation Layer**

**Reward thorough investigation:**
- Pattern emerges if they look
- Unbound connection is findable
- Sets up Act III villain

**But don't require it:**
- Can resolve crises without seeing pattern
- Just makes Quest 3.2 harder

### **Peace is Hard**

**This quest establishes theme:**
- Peace requires constant work
- Both sides need maintenance
- No victory, just daily survival
- This is the "good" ending they earned
- But "good" doesn't mean "easy"

---

## Transition to QUEST 3.2

**After resolving crises:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*You've bought peace another day. Maybe another week. But the incidents continue. And now you know: The Unbound are behind them.*
>
{{descriptive
*Corvus may be dead (or imprisoned, or in hiding). But his followers remain. Cells throughout both kingdoms. True believers who think war serves their goals.*
>
{{descriptive
*Quest 3.2: Hunt the Unbound. Root out the saboteurs. Before they succeed in breaking what you built.*

### **The CONFRONTATION**

**Elara's Monologue:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*"You. You killed my father. You stopped his vision. You condemned humanity to continue suffering.*
>
{{descriptive
*(She gestures around)*
>
{{descriptive
*"But his work continues. I've gathered the faithful. Recovered Component fragments. And in two weeks: We'll complete what he started.*
>
{{descriptive
*"Operation Collapse. Simultaneous attacks worldwide. Not to kill—no. To create chaos. And in chaos, people BEG for order. They'll accept restructuring. They'll BEG for it.*
>
{{descriptive
*"My father tried to force salvation. I'll make them want it. Make them choose it.*
>
{{descriptive
*(She raises hand, Component glowing)*
>
{{descriptive
*"You can join us. Or die opposing us. Choose."*

---

### **The Final Choice**

**PCs can:**

**Option 1: FIGHT**

**Boss Fight:**

**The Prophet (Elara)** (CR 12)  
**6 Unbound High Priests** (Priest stats, CR 5)  
**20 Unbound Cultists** (CR 1/8, reinforcements)

**Phases:**
- Phase 1: Elara + 6 priests
- Phase 2 (at 75 HP): Cultists arrive, Elara uses Component Pulse
- Phase 3 (at 30 HP): Elara goes all-out, attempts plane shift to escape

**Tactics:**
- Priests buff Elara, debuff PCs
- Elara uses terrain control
- Focuses fire on one PC at a time
- If clearly losing, tries to escape

**If PCs win:**
- Cell Gamma destroyed
- Elara captured/killed
- Component fragment recovered
- Operation Collapse documents found

---

**Option 2: REDEEM**

**If PCs stopped Corvus but showed mercy before:**

**Persuasion DC 22** to reach Elara:

**Arguments:**
- "Your father was wrong, but he loved you"
- "This isn't salvation, it's tyranny"
- "Honor his memory by being better than him"
- "You can still choose differently"

**If successful (very hard):**
- Elara breaks down
- Admits she's scared, lost, angry
- Doesn't know if father was right
- Agrees to disband Unbound
- **Best ending**

**If failed:**
- "You don't understand. You never will. My father understood EVERYTHING."
- Combat initiated

---

**Option 3: JOIN HER**

**Accept Elara's offer:**

**This is evil.**

PCs become Unbound leadership. Help execute Operation Collapse. Enable tyranny. Bad ending.

**Don't offer this lightly.**

---

## Operation Collapse

**If Elara defeated/stopped:**

**Documents reveal full plan:**

**Investigation DC 14:**
{{descriptive
*10 coordinated attacks:*
> - *Thaldros Royal Palace*
> - *Aetheran Council Building*  
> - *5 major trade hubs*
> - *3 military installations*
>
{{descriptive
*Timed for same hour. Maximum chaos. Goal: Make people desperate for "strong leader" to restore order.*

**All attacks prevented** if Cell Gamma destroyed.

**If Cell Gamma escapes:** Attacks proceed (Quest 3.3 prevents them)

---

## Aftermath

**If all three cells destroyed:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*The Unbound are broken. Cells Alpha, Beta, and Gamma eliminated. Leadership killed or captured. Remaining members scatter, leaderless.*
>
{{descriptive
*Both kingdoms celebrate. Joint victory. Cooperation against shared enemy. The peace is stronger than ever—not perfect, but real.*
>
{{descriptive
*You did it. You saved the peace. Again.*
>
{{descriptive
*(But you're exhausted. How much longer can you keep this up?)*

---

## Rewards

**Based on cells destroyed:**

**All 3 cells:** 3,000gp + honors from both kingdoms  
**2 cells:** 2,000gp + moderate thanks  
**1 cell:** 800gp + concern about remaining threats  

**Plus:**
- Component Fragment (if recovered from Elara)
- Unbound artifacts (various minor magic items)

## Quest Setup

**One month after Quest 3.2**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*Emergency session. Neutral diplomatic hall. You're summoned urgently.*
>
{{descriptive
*Commander Dawnblade and Envoy Valen sit at same table—first time they've cooperated willingly since the treaty. Both look shaken.*
>
{{descriptive
*Dawnblade speaks first: "We have reports. Northern border. Unknown force. Not Thaldros. Not Aethoria. Not Unbound."*
>
{{descriptive
*Valen continues: "Three villages destroyed. Completely. No survivors. No demands. No explanation. Just... annihilation."*
>
{{descriptive
*(They slide reconnaissance reports across table)*
>
{{descriptive
*"Whatever this is, it's coming south. Toward both our kingdoms. We estimate... two weeks until it reaches our borders.*
>
{{descriptive
*"For the first time in 500 years, Thaldros and Aethoria must fight together. Or die separately."*

---

## The External Threat

**What's attacking:**

### **The DREADHOST**

**Origin:** Northern Wastes beyond known borders

**Composition:**
- **Undead Legion** (10,000+ reanimated soldiers)
- **Necromancer Lords** (6 powerful casters)
- **The Dread King** (CR 18 necromancer lich)
- **Purpose:** Conquest and conversion (turn living into undead)

**Background:**

400 years ago, during the Godsfall, an ambitious king tried to achieve immortality using forbidden necromancy. Succeeded—became lich. Kingdom fell, all citizens converted to undead. For centuries, isolated in frozen north.

Now: Moving south. Need fresh corpses. Plan to convert both kingdoms.

**This is existential threat requiring unity.**

---

## The Intelligence

**Reconnaissance reports:**

**Read Aloud (From Reports):**

{{descriptive
*"Village of Northholm: Population 200. Found every citizen dead, reanimated within hours. Witnesses from nearby—before they fled—describe: 'Dead army. Thousands. Led by corpse-wizards in black robes. And at the rear... something ancient. Wearing crown of bone. The Dread King.'*
>
{{descriptive
*"Villages of Frostmere and Ironwood: Same fate. Total conversion. Undead population now estimated 10,600 and growing with each conquest.*
>
{{descriptive
*"Rate of advance: 30 miles per week. ETA to our borders: 14 days. ETA to capitals: 30-40 days."*

**Military assessment:**

{{descriptive
*"Thaldros military: 8,000 soldiers. Aethoria military: 6,000. Combined: 14,000.*
>
{{descriptive
*"Enemy forces: 10,600 undead (growing daily). Plus necromantic magic. Plus lich leadership.*
>
{{descriptive
*"Assessment: We're outnumbered. And our dead become their reinforcements. Without cooperation, we lose. Even with cooperation... uncertain."*

---

## Phase 1: Forge The Alliance

**PCs must unite the kingdoms:**

### **The Political Challenge**

**Problem:** Both kingdoms technically cooperating, but:
- Commanders don't trust each other
- Soldiers refuse to fight alongside "enemy"
- Logistics nightmare (different supply chains)
- Cultural differences (monarchy vs democracy)
- Old hatreds die hard

**PCs' Role:** Make it actually work

---

### **Challenge 1: Unified Command**

**Who commands combined army?**

**The Debate:**

**Thaldros Position (Dawnblade):**
{{descriptive
*"Unified command requires clear hierarchy. Thaldros has more experienced generals, better logistics, established chain of command. I should lead."*

**Aethoria Position (Valen):**
{{descriptive
*"Democracy means equal partnership. Joint command or no deal. We won't submit to monarchy's authority just because there's a crisis."*

**Both have valid points. Both refuse to budge.**

---

**PCs must mediate:**

**Option 1: Support Thaldros Command**
- **Persuasion DC 18** to convince Aethoria
- Argument: "Experience matters. Now's not time for democracy."
- If successful: Unified command under Dawnblade
- Consequence: Aethoria resentful but complies

**Option 2: Support Joint Command**
- **Persuasion DC 16** (easier, fair compromise)
- Argument: "Both contribute equally, both command equally."
- If successful: War council system
- Consequence: Slower decisions but better morale

**Option 3: Suggest Third-Party Command**
- **Persuasion DC 20** (bold)
- Argument: "Neither side leads. We—the Peacekeepers—command."
- If successful: PCs become Supreme Commanders
- Consequence: Ultimate responsibility falls on you

**Option 4: Split Forces**
- Let each kingdom fight independently
- Coordinate loosely
- Easier politically
- **Terrible strategically** (lich will defeat them separately)

---

### **Challenge 2: Troop Integration**

**How to make enemies fight together?**

**The Problem:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*The war camp is divided. Thaldros soldiers on west side. Aethoria militia on east. They avoid each other. Refuse to share supplies. Three fights broke out yesterday over who gets better tents.*
>
{{descriptive
*Officers report: Morale low. Soldiers don't want to die for "the enemy." Some considering desertion.*

---

**PCs must build unity:**

**Option 1: Joint Training Exercise**
- Force soldiers to drill together
- **Performance DC 16** (lead by example)
- Success: Grudging respect forms
- Time: 3 days

**Option 2: Shared Threat Reminder**
- Show them what they're fighting (bring undead prisoner OR testimonies from survivors)
- **Persuasion DC 15**
- Success: Fear overrides hatred
- Time: 1 day

**Option 3: Cultural Exchange**
- Organize joint meals, songs, storytelling
- **Persuasion DC 17**
- Success: Humanize each other
- Time: 5 days

**Option 4: Nothing**
- Let them stay divided
- They'll cooperate under fire (maybe)
- Risk: They might not

---

### **Challenge 3: Resource Allocation**

**Who gets limited resources?**

**The Scarcity:**
- Only 500 healing potions (need 1,000+)
- Only 100 magic weapons (undead resistant to normal)
- Only 50 clerics (Turn Undead is critical)

**Both sides want priority. PCs decide:**

**Option 1: Equal Split**
- Fair but insufficient for both
- Neither side satisfied but can't complain
- **Persuasion DC 14**

**Option 2: Merit-Based**
- Best units get priority
- Actually strategic
- Angers weaker units
- **Persuasion DC 17**

**Option 3: Front-Line Priority**
- Those facing worst danger get resources
- Makes sense tactically
- Morale boost for those chosen
- **Persuasion DC 15**

---

## Phase 2: The First Battle

**One week later. The Dreadhost arrives.**

### **The BATTLEFIELD**

**Location:** The Judgment Border (where war almost happened)

**Irony:** The place where you prevented war... now hosts battle to save both kingdoms.

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*Dawn. The Judgment Border. Your combined army: 14,000 living soldiers. Arrayed in defensive formation. Trenches. Stakes. Prepared positions.*
>
{{descriptive
*Then you see them. Cresting the northern hills. The Dreadhost.*
>
{{descriptive
*Row after row of undead. Thousands. Silent except for bone-rattle and armor-clank. No battle cries. No fear. No hesitation.*
>
{{descriptive
*At the rear: Six figures in black robes radiating necrotic energy. The Necromancer Lords.*
>
{{descriptive
*And beyond them: A palanquin carried by zombie ogres. On it sits: The Dread King. Ancient. Skeletal. Crown of bone. Lich.*
>
{{descriptive
*This is it. The battle for survival.*

---

### **The Battle Structure**

**This is large-scale battle. Don't run every soldier.**

**Abstract using three phases:**

---

**Battle Phase 1: The First Wave**

**Dreadhost sends forward 2,000 zombies:**

**PCs' Role:** Hold the center line

**Encounter:**

**40 Zombies** (CR 1/4, abstracted—PCs fight 40, represent larger battle)  
**4 Wights** (CR 3, squad leaders)  
**1 Death Knight** (CR 8, wave commander)

**Tactics:**
- Zombies mindlessly charge
- Wights command them
- Death Knight hangs back, eliminates strong defenders

**Allied Forces:** Handle rest of wave (abstracted)

**If PCs hold line:** First wave repelled, 200 allied casualties  
**If PCs fail:** Line breaks, 500 casualties, bad morale

---

**Battle Phase 2: Necromantic Assault**

**Necromancer Lords begin raising fallen:**

**The Horror:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*Your dead begin rising. Allied soldiers—killed minutes ago—stand up. Eyes vacant. They attack their former comrades.*
>
{{descriptive
*Morale plummets. Soldiers panic: "We're losing even when we win! Every death makes them stronger!"*
>
{{descriptive
*Someone needs to stop the necromancers.*

---

**PCs' Role:** Counter-battery mission

**Options:**

**Option A: Direct Assault**
- Charge necromancer lines
- Fight through undead to reach casters
- Very dangerous
- 2 encounters (undead screen + necromancers)

**Option B: Aerial Approach**
- Fly over battle (if PCs have flight)
- Bypass undead
- Surprise necromancers
- 1 encounter (necromancers only)

**Option C: Clerical Strike**
- Lead 50 clerics in Turn Undead wave
- Clear path to necromancers
- Religion DC 16 to coordinate
- Success: Path cleared, 1 encounter (necromancers)

---

**Encounter:**

**2 Necromancer Lords** (CR 12 each)

**Use Lich stats but weaker:**

**AC:** 17 | **HP:** 150 each | **Speed:** 30 ft.

**Spellcasting (DC 17, +9 to hit):**

**At will:** *ray of frost, chill touch*  
**3/day:** *animate dead, blight, dimension door*  
**2/day:** *circle of death, cloudkill*  
**1/day:** *finger of death, power word pain*

**Legendary Actions (2 per lord):**
- Cast cantrip
- Animate dead (raises 1d4 zombies nearby)
- Necrotic Burst (20-ft radius, 3d8 necrotic, DC 17 Con save half)

**If both killed:** Allied dead stop rising. Major morale boost.

---

**Battle Phase 3: The Dread King Attacks**

**Lich enters battle personally:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*The palanquin lowers. The Dread King stands. Ancient robes. Bone crown. Eyes glowing with centuries of hatred.*
>
{{descriptive
*He raises skeletal hands. Speaks one word in a dead language.*
>
{{descriptive
*TERROR.*
>
{{descriptive
*Every soldier on battlefield must make DC 18 Wisdom save or flee in panic. Your combined army is routing.*
>
{{descriptive
*Only you—heroes of legend—resist. You and maybe a dozen other veterans.*
>
{{descriptive
*The Dread King points at you. Recognizes threats. Advances.*

---

**Boss Fight Preview:**

**Don't fight him yet.** He's CR 18. PCs are 13. They'll lose.

**Instead:**

**PCs must:**
- Rally troops (Persuasion/Performance DC 18)
- Hold the line (survive 3 rounds against Dread King's attacks)
- Buy time for commanders to organize retreat

**The Dread King attacks from range:**
- **Finger of Death** (7d8 + 30 necrotic, DC 18 Con save half)
- **Power Word Kill** (if any PC below 100 HP, they die)
- **Animate Army** (all fallen soldiers rise as zombies)

**PCs must survive 3 rounds. Then:**

**Dawnblade + Valen arrive with elite guards:**

{{descriptive
*"FALL BACK! Organized retreat! We can't win here!"*

**Allied army retreats. Loses 2,000 soldiers but survives.**

**Dread King doesn't pursue. He's patient. Converts fallen to undead. Now has 12,600 troops.**

---

## Phase 3: The Counter-Strategy

**War council, that night:**

### **The Strategic Situation**

**Grim facts:**
- Lost first battle
- Enemy stronger (gained 2,000 undead)
- Morale shattered
- Can't win conventional war

**Dawnblade:** "We need new strategy."  
**Valen:** "Agreed. But what?"

---

**PCs can suggest strategies:**

**Strategy A: Decapitation Strike**
- Kill the Dread King, horde collapses
- High-risk, high-reward
- Requires small team (PCs) infiltrating enemy
- 90% chance of success vs guaranteed slow loss

**Strategy B: Scorched Earth**
- Retreat, burn everything, deny corpses
- Slow enemy advance
- Buys time but costs civilian lives
- Eventually run out of land

**Strategy C: Divine Intervention**
- Seek help from temples, gods, powerful beings
- Time-consuming (1 week to gather)
- Uncertain (will gods help?)
- But potentially game-changing

**Strategy D: Alliance with Third Party**
- Seek help from: Dwarven kingdoms? Elven forests? Others?
- Diplomatic mission
- Takes time
- Might work

**Strategy E: Magical Solution**
- Research anti-undead weapon/spell
- Scholars, wizards, libraries
- Takes 1 week
- Might find something

---

**DM Guidance:** Strategy A (Decapitation) is meant to be chosen. It leads to climax.

---

## Chosen Strategy: Decapitation Strike

**If PCs choose to kill the Dread King:**

### **The Plan**

**Dawnblade:** "Small team. Infiltrate enemy camp. Kill the lich. Without him, the horde loses cohesion."

**Valen:** "It's a suicide mission."

**PCs:** "We'll do it."

**Preparation:**

PCs can recruit up to 4 NPC allies from:
- Dawnblade herself (if she trusts them)
- Valen himself (if he's brave enough)
- Iron Guild mercenaries (Varak if alive)
- Black Chains fighters (Kael if alive)
- Marcus Blackwood (if alive from Quest 1.5)
- Red Wolf (if alive from Quest 1.3)
- Any other major ally from previous quests

**Each ally provides unique benefit:**
- Dawnblade: Tank, paladin support
- Valen: Control magic, inspiration
- Varak: Tanking, dwarf resilience
- Kael: DPS, ruthless tactics
- Marcus: Intelligence, tactical advice
- Red Wolf: Stealth, guerrilla tactics

---

### **The Infiltration**

**Night. Behind enemy lines:**

**Three obstacles:**

**Obstacle 1: Undead Patrols**
- **Stealth DC 17** (group check) to avoid 100+ zombies
- Failure: Combat with 20 zombies + 2 wights
- Success: Bypass undetected

**Obstacle 2: Necromantic Wards**
- **Arcana DC 18** to dispel alarm wards
- Failure: Necromancer Lords alerted (harder boss fight)
- Success: Approach undetected

**Obstacle 3: Inner Sanctum**
- Dread King's tent/throne room
- 6 **Skeleton Champions** guard (CR 3 each)
- Must fight (can't stealth past these)

---

## Final Boss: The Dread King

**In his sanctum:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*The Dread King sits on throne of skulls. Ancient lich. Crown of bone. Staff of dark crystal. Eyes that have seen centuries.*
>
{{descriptive
*He doesn't rise. Doesn't seem surprised.*
>
{{descriptive
*"Ah. Heroes. Come to slay the monster. How... predictable."*
>
{{descriptive
*(His voice is dry, ancient, amused)*
>
{{descriptive
*"I conquered death itself. You think you can kill me? Amusing. Very well. Entertain me before you join my legion."*

**Phase 1: Testing (Rounds 1-3)**

Dread King assesses threat:

- Casts *mirror image* and defensive buffs
- Summons undead minions
- Tests PCs' capabilities

---

---

**Phase 4: Defeated**

**If reduced to 0 HP:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*The Dread King crumbles. Bones clatter to floor. Crown rolls away. Staff cracks. Ancient robes collapse into dust.*
>
{{descriptive
*(But you hear his voice, fading)*
>
{{descriptive
*"Well played... heroes. But I am deathless. My phylactery endures. In ten days... I return. This... is not... over..."*
>
{{descriptive
*(Silence. He's gone. For now.)*

**Outside:** The entire undead horde collapses. 12,600 corpses fall lifeless. Threat ended.

**For now.**

---

## Aftermath

**Victory, but...**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*You return to camp as dawn breaks. Carry news: The Dread King is defeated. His horde collapsed.*
>
{{descriptive
*Both armies erupt in celebration. Thaldros and Aethoria soldiers embrace. Enemies becoming brothers through shared survival.*
>
{{descriptive
*Dawnblade approaches, salutes: "You saved us. Both kingdoms owe you everything."*
>
{{descriptive
*Valen kneels: "Heroes of the realm. Both realms. True Peacekeepers."*
>
{{descriptive
*But you know the truth: The phylactery remains. In 10 days, the Dread King returns. This victory is temporary.*

---

## The Choice

**PCs must decide:**

**Option 1: Hunt the Phylactery**
- Travel north to Dread King's original kingdom
- Find and destroy phylactery
- Permanent solution
- Very dangerous (unexplored frozen wastes)
- **This becomes Quest 3.4**

**Option 2: Fortify Defenses**
- Prepare for his return
- 10 days to build massive fortifications
- When he returns, defeat him again (and again, and again)
- Temporary solution

---

## Quest Setup

**Ten days after Quest 3.3**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*You stand at the docks. Frozen north before you. Ship prepared. Supplies loaded. Both kingdoms contributed everything: Maps (unreliable), supplies (essential), soldiers (volunteers—most won't return).*
>
{{descriptive
*Dawnblade and Valen see you off:*
>
{{descriptive
*Dawnblade: "Eight days left before he returns. Find the phylactery. Destroy it. Or we face him again. Forever."*
>
{{descriptive
*Valen: "You've done the impossible before. Do it one more time. Come back heroes. Or don't come back at all."*
>
{{descriptive
*(The ship launches. You're bound for the Frozen Kingdom. Legend. Nightmare. Tomb.)*

---

## The Voyage North

**Five days by ship through frozen seas:**

### **Day 1-2: Normal Sailing**

Uneventful. Crew nervous. Temperature dropping.

---

### **Day 3: The Ice Field**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*Ice. Everywhere. Sea frozen solid. Ship can't advance. Navigator: "We're 200 miles from the Frozen Kingdom. Rest of journey on foot.*
>
{{descriptive
*You see it on horizon: Ancient city. Black stone. Towers of ice. Dead. Waiting.*

**PCs must abandon ship. March across frozen wasteland.**

---

### **DAY 4-5: The MARCH**

**Survival challenges:**

**Challenge 1: Blizzard**
- Survival DC 16 or take 2d6 cold damage per hour
- Constitution DC 15 or gain exhaustion
- Risk of getting lost (no visibility)

**Challenge 2: Frozen Undead**
- Encounter with **4 Wights** and **8 Zombies**
- Frozen in ice, thaw when PCs approach
- Cold-enhanced (resistance to fire)

**Challenge 3: The Phantom Legion**
- Ghostly army from ancient battle
- **6 Wraiths** (CR 5 each)
- Don't attack unless provoked
- Can be negotiated with (they hate Dread King too)

---

## The Frozen Kingdom

**Arrival at dead city:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*The Frozen Kingdom. 400 years abandoned. Black stone towers coated in ice. Streets empty. No movement. No sound. Just wind and cold.*
>
{{descriptive
*This was once capital of prosperous realm. 50,000 citizens. Now: Nothing. Just frozen monuments to dead ambition.*
>
{{descriptive
*The phylactery is here. Somewhere. But where?*

---

### **Investigation Phase**

**PCs must locate phylactery:**

**Option 1: Search Systematically**
- Investigation DC 18 (takes 2 days)
- Each day: 1d4 undead encounters
- Success: Find phylactery location

**Option 2: Use Magic**
- *Locate object* (doesn't work—phylactery warded)
- *Legend lore* (reveals clue in riddle form)
- *Divination* (gods give cryptic answer)

**Option 3: Question the Dead**
- *Speak with dead* on ancient corpses
- They remember (barely)
- "Crown... worn even in death... the throne room... always on throne..."

**The Clue:**

Phylactery is in the Dread King's original crown. He wears it always. Even when he "dies," crown remains. It's the phylactery itself.

**Revelation:** They've been fighting him wrong. Crown must be destroyed while he's dead (before he reforms).

---

## The Throne Room

**Center of dead city. Massive palace:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*The palace. Frozen. Grand hall leading to throne room. Ice sculptures of courtiers line the walls—these were real people once. Flash-frozen during the transformation.*
>
{{descriptive
*You reach throne room. Empty throne. Stone. Cold. And on it: A crown. Bone and black metal. Pulsing with necrotic energy.*
>
{{descriptive
*The phylactery. Unguarded. Just sitting there. As if daring you.*

---

### **The TRAP**

**It's too easy. It's a trap:**

**If PCs approach crown:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*As you reach for the crown, the air FREEZES. The throne room doors slam shut. Ice spreads across floor. And from the crown itself: A voice.*
>
{{descriptive
*"Did you truly think I'd leave it unguarded?"*
>
{{descriptive
*(The Dread King materializes. Early. He reformed FASTER this time.)*
>
{{descriptive
*"You've improved. So have I. Let's try this again."*

---

## Final Boss: The Dread King (Empowered)

**He's learned from first defeat. Now CR 19.**

**Changes from first fight:**
- Anticipated your tactics
- Pre-cast buffs (*globe of invulnerability*, *stoneskin*)
- Summoned guardians before you arrived
- Using environment (ice, cold)
- Fighting smarter, not harder

**Empowered Dread King (CR 19)**

**Same stats as before, but:**

**New Abilities:**

**Learned Tactics:** Advantage on saves against effects he's experienced before (your tactics from Quest 3.3).

**Frozen Domain:** Throne room is difficult terrain (ice). Each round, all creatures make DC 17 Con save or take 3d6 cold damage.

**Phylactery Link:** While within 60 ft. of crown, regenerates 20 HP per turn.

**Guardian Summons (1/Day):** Summons 4 **Ice Golems** (CR 10 each) from frozen courtiers.

---

### **The Real Challenge**

**This fight is two-fold:**

1. **Kill the Dread King** (again)
2. **Destroy the phylactery/crown** (before he regenerates)

**Problem:** Crown is AC 20, 100 HP, resistance to all damage except radiant and force. While Dread King alive, he defends it. If he dies, you have ~3 rounds before he reforms.

---

### **Battle Strategy**

**PCs must:**

**Phase 1: Defeat Dread King**
- Same as before but harder
- He knows your tricks
- Uses terrain advantage
- Ice Golems tank

**Phase 2: Destroy Crown (3 rounds)**
- After Dread King "dies"
- Crown is now attackable
- But clock is ticking
- And Ice Golems still fight

**Phase 3: Escape**
- Palace collapsing (phylactery was keystone)
- Must flee (Athletics/Acrobatics checks)
- Or get buried in ice

---

### **Alternative ApproachES**

**Smart PCs might:**

**Option A: Split Party**
- Some fight Dread King
- Others focus-fire crown
- Risky but effective

**Option B: Distract and Destroy**
- One PC distracts Dread King (kiting)
- Others destroy crown immediately
- When crown breaks, he dies permanently
- Very risky for distractor

**Option C: Environmental Hazard**
- Collapse palace around him
- Bring down ceiling
- Crown gets buried but possibly destroyed
- Riskiest

---

## Crown Destruction Scene

**When crown finally breaks:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*The crown SHATTERS. Bone splinters. Black metal fragments.*
>
{{descriptive
*The Dread King SCREAMS. Ancient voice filled with rage, terror, and disbelief.*
>
{{descriptive
*"No. NO! I conquered DEATH! I cannot—"*
>
{{descriptive
*(He disintegrates. Dust. Gone. Forever.)*
>
{{descriptive
*The ice begins melting. The frozen courtiers crumble. The Frozen Kingdom... is finally dead. And free.*
>
{{descriptive
*Outside, across the realm: Every undead he ever created collapses. Thousands of corpses finally rest.*
>
{{descriptive
*It's over. Truly over.*

---

## The Return

**Five days later. Return to allied kingdoms:**

**Hero'S Welcome:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*You return to find both kingdoms in celebration. News arrived ahead (via sending spells): The Dread King is DEAD. Permanently. The threat is ended.*
>
{{descriptive
*Streets packed with Thaldros and Aethoria citizens—together. No longer enemies. Unified by shared victory.*
>
{{descriptive
*Dawnblade and Valen meet you with full military honors. Banners of both kingdoms side-by-side.*
>
{{descriptive
*"You've saved us three times now," Valen says. "Prevented the war. United us against the undead. And ended the greatest threat we've ever faced."*
>
{{descriptive
*Dawnblade nods. "Both kingdoms owe you everything. Name your reward. Anything."*
>
{{descriptive
*(They're serious. Anything.)*

---

## The Proposal

**PCs can now shape the future:**

### **Option 1: REQUEST GOLD**

**Simple:**
- 10,000gp (enormous wealth)
- Lands and titles
- Lifetime pensions
- Retire as legends

**Outcome:**
- Kingdoms remain separate but allied
- Peace holds (strong alliance)
- You're wealthy heroes
- Act III ends with stable peace

---

### **Option 2: Propose Full Unification**

**Bold:**

**Persuasion DC 18** to seriously consider:

**Argument:**
> "You've proven you can work together. The peace is strong. Why maintain the division? Unify. One nation. Stronger together."

**Dawnblade's Response:**
> "Merge Thaldros and Aethoria? Monarchy and democracy? How would that even work?"

**Valen's Response:**
> "Interesting. A federation? Constitutional monarchy? Some hybrid? It's... possible."

---

**If DC met, they consider it:**

**The Debate:**

**Three models proposed:**

**Model A: Constitutional Monarchy**
- King/Queen as figurehead
- Elected parliament with real power
- Combines tradition with democracy
- Persuasion DC 16 to get both to accept

**Model B: Federal Republic**
- Two states, one nation
- Thaldros keeps monarchy locally
- Aethoria keeps democracy locally
- Federal government above both
- Persuasion DC 17 (complex but fair)

**Model C: Complete Merger**
- Dissolve both governments
- Create entirely new system
- Emperor/Empress (elected? hereditary?)
- Persuasion DC 20 (radical change)

---

**If unification succeeds:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*Three months of negotiations. Compromises. Debates. Constitutional conventions. But finally:*
>
{{descriptive
*The Treaty of Unity. Thaldros and Aethoria become: The United Realm of Tirvandor.*
>
{{descriptive
*[Chosen system] established. Borders dissolved. One flag flies. One nation stands.*
>
{{descriptive
*Citizens celebrate. Merchants rejoice (unified markets). Generals approve (stronger military). Historians marvel.*
>
{{descriptive
*You've done it. Not just peace. Not just alliance. But true unification. Two ancient rivals become one.*
>
{{descriptive
*The world will never be the same.*

---

### **Option 3: REJECT BOTH**

**Humble:**
- "We want no reward. We did what was right."
- Reputation: +30 with everyone (legendary humility)
- Both kingdoms insist on giving SOMETHING
- Compromise: Statues erected, holidays named after you

---

### **Option 4: Make Specific Requests**

**PCs can request almost anything:**
- Pardon for past crimes
- Ressurect dead allies
- Hunt down specific enemies
- Change specific laws
- Free specific prisoners
- Literally almost anything reasonable

**Both kingdoms will grant it** (within reason).

---

## Rewards

**Based on choice:**

**If requested gold:** 10,000gp + lands + titles  
**If proposed unification:** 5,000gp + titles + LEGACY (changed history)  
**If rejected rewards:** 0gp + legendary reputation + moral satisfaction  

**Plus (all):**
- Dread King's artifacts (legendary items)
- Reputation: +30 with both kingdoms (or unified kingdom)
- Title: "Unifiers" or "Saviors" or "The Humble Heroes"
- Can retire or continue adventuring

---

## Level Up

**PCs reach Level 15** after Quest 3.4.

**Maximum power:**
- 8th level spells
- Legendary class features
- Can challenge gods
- True heroes

---

## The Epilogue Preview

**One year later:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*One year since unification (or alliance). Peace reigns. Trade flows. Prosperity grows.*
>
{{descriptive
*But you receive message. From both/all leaders. Urgent. One final matter requires your attention.*
>
{{descriptive
*Quest 3.5: The Mediator's Rest. Your final decision. Your legacy. Your ending.*

---

## DM Guidance

### **Running the Final Dread King Fight**

- Environmental advantage
- Time pressure (destroy crown)

**But winnable:**
- PCs are Level 14
- They have experience from first fight
- Allies can help
- Creative solutions possible

### **The Unification Proposal**

**Present as serious option:**
- Players worked for peace 3 years (game time)
- Earned right to shape future
- Both kingdoms trust them
- It's ambitious but possible

**Don't force it:**
- Some players prefer simple victory
- That's valid
- Either ending is satisfying

### **Legacy Considerations**

- Sets up final legacy
- Players define what they built
- Peace? Alliance? Empire?
- All valid choices

>
{{descriptive
*You're legends now. Songs sung about you. Statues in every city. Children play "Peacekeepers vs. Dreadhost." You're immortalized.*
>
{{descriptive
*But legends can't rest. Not yet. One final summons arrives: "Emergency council. Your presence required. Immediately."*

---

## The Revelation

**Dawnblade speaks:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*"We've gathered everyone because we must decide: What happens to the Peacekeepers?*
>
{{descriptive
*"You've served beyond any reasonable expectation. Three years. Fifteen impossible tasks. You've earned rest. Retirement. Whatever you want.*
>
{{descriptive
*"But the peace you built still needs maintenance. Disputes arise. Tensions flare. Having neutral arbiters—trusted by all—is vital.*
>
{{descriptive
*"The question: Do the Peacekeepers continue? And if so... is it still you?"*

---

**Valen continues:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*"We propose three options:*
>
{{descriptive
*"ONE: You continue as Peacekeepers. Forever (or until you die). The peace rests on your shoulders. Eternal duty.*
>
{{descriptive
*"TWO: You train successors. Pass the mantle. Build an institution. Peacekeepers continue, but not necessarily YOU.*
>
{{descriptive
*"THREE: You retire. The role of Peacekeeper ends with you. We'll figure something else out.*
>
{{descriptive
*"But the choice is yours. You earned it. You decide how your story ends."*

---

## The Final Choice

**This is it. The campaign-defining decision:**

---

### **Ending 1: Eternal Vigil**

**PCs choose to continue as Peacekeepers:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*You accept. The peace needs guardians. You'll be those guardians. For as long as you live.*
>
{{descriptive
*Years pass. Decades. You mediate disputes. Prevent wars. Train new generations. You become myths. Living legends who never stop.*
>
{{descriptive
*Some of you marry. Have families. Grow old. But the duty never ends. Every generation has new conflicts. New threats. And you're there. Always.*
>
{{descriptive
*Eventually, one by one, you fall. Age. Battle. Sacrifice. But each time, the survivors carry on. Until the last Peacekeeper dies, ancient and tired, having served for 50+ years.*
>
{{descriptive
*Your legacy: You gave everything. Every year. Every day. The peace held because YOU held it.*
>
{{descriptive
*Is that enough?*

**Epilogue:**

**Each PC gets personal ending:**
- Marriages, families, achievements
- How they died (heroically or peacefully)
- What they're remembered for
- Statues, holidays, legends

**World State:**
- Peace holds for 50+ years
- Minor conflicts but never war
- Prosperity, growth, progress
- Your sacrifice made it possible

**DM narrates individual player epilogues based on their choices throughout campaign.**

---

### **Ending 2: The Institution**

**PCs choose to train successors:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*You accept the compromise. You'll create the Peacekeeper Academy. Train the next generation. Build an institution that outlives you.*
>
{{descriptive
*Five years of work. You recruit, train, test hundreds of candidates. You select the best: Young, idealistic, skilled. You teach them everything you know.*
>
{{descriptive
*Diplomacy. Combat. Investigation. Ethics. When to fight. When to talk. When to compromise. The grey wisdom you learned across 15 quests.*
>
{{descriptive
*Eventually, the Academy is self-sustaining. 50 trained Peacekeepers. 200 in training. An institution. A legacy.*
>
{{descriptive
*You finally retire. Different paths:*

**Individual Retirements:**

**PCs can choose:**
- **Settle down:** Marry, family, peaceful life
- **Keep adventuring:** New quests, personal goals
- **Politics:** Join government, shape policy
- **Teaching:** Stay at Academy as instructors
- **Disappear:** Vanish into anonymity, mystery

**Epilogue:**

**Each PC gets personalized ending based on choice.**

**World State:**
- Peace holds (institutionally maintained)
- Peacekeeper Academy becomes legendary
- New generation takes over
- You watch from retirement, proud

---

### **Ending 3: Retirement**

**PCs choose to end the role entirely:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*You decline. "The peace should stand on its own. If it requires us forever, it's not real peace. It's dependency."*
>
{{descriptive
*(Shocked silence)*
>
{{descriptive
*Dawnblade: "But who will—"*
>
{{descriptive
*You: "You will. All of you. You've relied on us for three years. Time to grow up. Make it work yourselves."*
>
{{descriptive
*(It's harsh. But it's true.)*
>
{{descriptive
*You walk away. The role of Peacekeeper ends with you. The kingdoms must learn to maintain peace themselves.*

**What happens next?**

**Roll d20 for world outcome:**

**1-5: Peace Breaks**
- Without you, kingdoms revert to conflict
- War resumes within 5 years
- Your legacy: Temporary solution
- Tragic ending

**6-15: Peace Holds (Barely)**
- Rough transition
- Several close calls
- But kingdoms mature
- Learn to maintain peace independently
- Your legacy: Taught them to fish

**16-20: Peace Strengthens**
- Without dependence on heroes, institutions improve
- Systems replace individuals
- Democracy works
- Permanent peace emerges
- Your legacy: You made yourselves unnecessary (highest achievement)

**DM chooses or rolls based on how well PCs prepared the kingdoms throughout campaign.**

**Individual Retirements:**

Same options as Ending 2 - each PC retires how they wish.

---

## Personal Epilogues

**Regardless of ending chosen, each PC gets personalized conclusion:**

### **Epilogue Scene For Each Pc**

**DM asks each player:**

1. "How does [PC name] spend their final years?"
2. "What's their greatest personal achievement post-campaign?"
3. "How are they remembered?"
4. "When/how do they die?" (if desired)

**Narrate based on their choices throughout campaign:**

**Example 1: Warrior PC who showed mercy**
{{descriptive
*You settle in a small village. Open a training hall. Teach young people combat—but more importantly, when NOT to fight. You become legendary not for battles won, but for battles prevented. You die at 80, surrounded by grateful students, having never killed another person after the campaign ended.*

**Example 2: Rogue PC who stayed pragmatic**
{{descriptive
*You use your vast wealth to build trade empire. Smuggling networks become legitimate businesses. You create thousands of jobs. Die rich, respected, and slightly bored. Your fortune funds scholarships for thieves who want to go straight.*

**Example 3: Cleric PC who struggled with faith**
{{descriptive
*You write theological treatise: "The Gods in Grey." Becomes foundational text for new religious philosophy embracing moral complexity. Start new religious order. Die peacefully, faith intact, having reconciled belief with reality.*

**Customize for each PC based on their journey.**

---

## The Reunion (20 Years Later)

**Optional final scene:**

**Read Aloud:**

{{descriptive
*Twenty years later. You gather at memorial site (statue of yourselves, or Academy, or battleground). Most of you are alive. Some aren't. Some came as ghosts to see friends one more time.*
>
{{descriptive
*(PCs who died can appear as spirits for this scene)*
>
{{descriptive
*You look at each other. Older. Grey. Scarred. But alive. You survived.*
>
{{descriptive
*Someone raises toast: "To the Peacekeepers. To the impossible. To blood, coin, and everything between."*
>
{{descriptive
*You drink. You remember. You laugh about old fights. Cry about fallen friends. Wonder at what you built.*
>
{{descriptive
*Then you look out at the world you created: Peace. Prosperity. Children playing where battles were fought. Enemies' grandchildren marrying each other.*
>
{{descriptive
*Was it worth it? Every impossible choice. Every moral compromise. Every sleepless night.*
>
{{descriptive
*(You look at each other. And smile.)*
>
{{descriptive
*Yeah. It was worth it.*

**Read Aloud (Final Words):**

{{descriptive
*Years from now, long after you're gone, people will ask: "Were the Peacekeepers real? Or legend?"*
>
{{descriptive
*The answer is: Both. You were real people who became legends. Flawed individuals who achieved the impossible.*
>
{{descriptive
*You stopped a war. You prevented an apocalypse. You defeated a lich. You united kingdoms. You brought peace to a world that had forgotten how.*
>
{{descriptive
*Not because you were chosen. Not because you were pure. Not because you were perfect.*
>
{{descriptive
*But because you chose to. Every day. Every impossible choice. You chose to try.*
>
{{descriptive
*And in the end, in the grey world of blood and coin, of moral compromise and necessary evil, of pragmatic heroism and earned peace...*

- What if you joined Thaldros from start?
- What if you helped Corvus?
- What if war happened?
- Explore alternate endings

### **Option D: TRUE ENDING**

**One final epic quest (Level 16-20):**

**Years later, final threat emerges:**
- Bigger than anything before
- Requires you to come out of retirement
- "One last job"
- Ultimate challenge

**This could be:**
- Divine threat (gods return)
- Planar invasion (fiends/celestials)
- Ancient evil (elder being)
- Whatever DM wants

**But the main campaign is complete. This is optional bonus content.**

# DM Notes

### **Monster Usage Guidelines:**

**Acts I-II:** Mix of humanoid enemies (guards, cultists, mercenaries)  
**Act II Finale:** Large-scale armies abstracted  
**Act III:** Mix of continued humanoids + undead threat  

### **Scaling Encounters:**

- **Low levels (1-5):** Use guards, cultists, bandits in groups of 4-8
- **Mid levels (6-11):** Knights, veterans, fanatics in groups of 2-6
- **High levels (11-15):** Elite enemies, undead hordes, boss monsters

### **Moral Complexity:**

Many "enemies" aren't evil:
- War refugees are innocents
- Aethoria militia are fighting for freedom
- Thornwood rangers are freedom fighters
- Some cultists are desperate/misled

**Don't make all combats simple good vs evil**

**Total Monster Types: 30+**

## CAMPAIGN THEMES

**Core Theme:** Moral ambiguity in conflict
- No faction is purely good or evil
- Player choices have lasting consequences
- War affects everyone differently
- Power corrupts, even good intentions

**Secondary Themes:**
- Loyalty vs. personal ethics
- Cost of peace vs. cost of war
- Individual agency in grand conflicts
- Redemption and betrayal

---

## IMPROVISATION TIPS

### When Players Go Off-Script
1. Have 2-3 random NPCs ready (names, personalities)
2. Keep generic combat encounters prepared (bandits, guards, monsters)
3. Use faction reactions to guide consequences
4. Remember: player choices should matter, but campaign can adapt

### Adjusting Difficulty
- **Too Easy:** Add reinforcements, environmental hazards, time pressure
- **Too Hard:** Give tactical advantage, allow clever solutions, add NPC aid
- **Just Right:** Players win but use resources, feel accomplished

### Pacing
- **Session feels slow:** Skip to action, introduce complication
- **Session feels rushed:** Add roleplay moment, let players breathe
- **Players stuck:** Give subtle hint through NPC or environmental clue

---

*Remember: This is YOUR campaign. Adapt freely, reward creativity, and most importantly—have fun!*

### Quest 3.2 Example
**Situation:** Discover Corvus was manipulating everything
**Choice 1:** Expose immediately - Corvus escapes, gains time to prepare
**Choice 2:** Play along - Learn more, but risk being discovered
**Choice 3:** Turn tables - Try to manipulate Corvus (very difficult)
**DM Tip:** Players should feel betrayed. Make revelation dramatic.

## SESSION ZERO GUIDANCE

### Set Expectations
- This is a MORALLY GREY campaign
- Player characters may commit morally questionable acts
- No guaranteed "happy ending"
- Player choices have permanent consequences
- War and its horrors will be depicted

### Establish Safety Tools
- Lines: Topics to completely avoid
- Veils: Topics to acknowledge but not detail
- X-Card: Any player can stop scene, no questions
- Check-ins: Pause if anyone uncomfortable

### Character Creation Guidelines
- Mercenaries or those willing to work as mercenaries
- Motivated by gold, survival, or pragmatic goals
- Not zealots or absolute pacifists (campaign won't work)
- Backstory connections to Crossroads encouraged
- Consider: Why would your character take morally grey contracts?

### Party Cohesion
- Establish shared history or mutual need
- Define why characters trust each other (even if cautiously)
- Agree on red lines the party won't cross
- Accept that party may disagree on major decisions

## ADAPTING FOR YOUR TABLE

### If Players Are More Heroic
- Emphasize civilian suffering to motivate heroic choices
- Provide more chances for redemption arcs
- Make NPCs more sympathetic and redeemable
- Tone down faction atrocities slightly
- Still maintain consequences but lighter touch

### If Players Are More Ruthless
- Embrace the mercenary lifestyle fully
- Show world becoming darker due to choices
- Introduce even darker enemies to contrast
- Make pragmatic choices more obviously beneficial
- Consider darker ending more likely

### If Players Are Stuck
- Have Lucky Finn or other informant provide intel
- Elara can have vision pointing direction
- Faction handler can give strong hint
- Environmental clues can guide (wanted posters, rumors, etc.)
- Avoid direct railroad, but provide clear options

### If Campaign Going Off Rails
- Remember: Corvus is manipulating everything
- Any major deviation can be Corvus plan
- Faction leaders can adjust strategies
- New NPCs can emerge to redirect
- Worst case: Time skip to next major plot point

1. "The Iron Guild is neutral, but Varak has favorites..."
2. "That prophet girl in the square? She predicted the grain fire. Exactly."
3. "Thornwood Syndicate runs half this town. Guards look the other way."
4. "Strange ships at the docks. Flying foreign colors I don't recognize."
5. "The Black Chains are recruiting. Assassins' guild, very selective."
6. "Tensions between kingdoms getting worse. War's coming."
7. "Someone's buying up all the silver. Weird, right?"
8. "The old temple district? Avoid it. Things happen there at night."

# 🎭 Blood & Coin Campaign Handouts

## 11. Crime Family Letter - Intercepted

```
[Written in crude handwriting on cheap paper]

Boss,

The shipment arrived. Three crates of "wine"
from across the sea. You know what I mean.

Problem: Guards asking questions. Someone
tipped them. I think it's the new guy, the
one with the scar. Don't trust him.

Payment: 500 crowns, as agreed. Meeting at
the usual place. Midnight. Three knocks.

Watch for the City Watch. They've been
sniffing around the warehouse district.

If this goes bad, I don't know you.

- K

[Sealed with red wax, broken]
[Stamp: A coin with a crown]
```

**DM Note:** Give this to players if they intercept/steal/find it. Can lead to ambush opportunity or tracking the crime ring.

# Blood & Coin

*You're not heroes. You're professionals.*

___

Welcome to **Crossroads**, where the only laws are contracts and survival. In **Blood & Coin**, you'll navigate a world of mercenary politics, criminal enterprises, and moral compromise.

**This campaign will challenge you to:**
- Make impossible choices where there's no "right" answer
- Build a reputation that opens doors—or closes them
- Balance profit against principle
- Survive in a world that doesn't care about your intentions

From fresh meat in the Iron Guild to power brokers who shape nations, your choices will echo through Tirvandor's history.

*Everyone has a price. What's yours?*
